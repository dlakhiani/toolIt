Almost all of them work in the same way: the fluid goes through one or more sheets of porous paper in which these impurities are caught.</p><p><strong>⚠️ There is one main problem with filters:</strong></p><p>As time goes on, particles are accumulated in the filters and <strong>overload</strong> them, so the fluids (either fuel, air, or oil) cannot flow through them anymore. When this happens, we say that <strong>the filter is “clogged.”</strong></p><h2>When should you change the filters of your 124?</h2><ul><li><strong>Air filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> They must usually be replaced every <strong>7,000 miles.</strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_aire_admision.jpg\"></div>Purpose: they purify the air that gets into the cylinders. It catches any impurities that may be in the air, such as dirt, sand, plant remains, bugs, etc. It is essential to keep the internal surfaces of both cylinders and piston rings clean, which also diminishes their wear.  It is found inside the engine compartment, inside of a plastic black box (air cleaner case).</li><li><strong>Fuel filter</strong>:   <strong></strong>Fuel filters should be replaced <strong>every 10,000 miles or once a year</strong>. Diesel filters usually last longer, so it is advisable to change them after <strong>30,000 miles</strong>. <strong></strong><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_de_combustible.png\"></div>Purpose: it catches all the impurities in the fuel that may come from the fuel tank. It prevents the injectors, as well as some other parts of the fuel feed system, from getting dirty. In Diesel cars, they also catch the water that may be in the fuel.This filter is usually close to the fuel tank in gasoline cars, and you can access it right under it. On the other hand, in Diesel cars, this filter is placed inside the engine compartment.</li><li><strong>Motor oil filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> They must usually be replaced <strong>every 5,000 - 10,000 miles (when you change the oil).</strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_aceite.jpg\"></div>Purpose: one of the purposes of the motor oil is to clean the engine and prevent dirt from sticking into metallic surfaces. The dirt transported by the oil is caught in the filter to prevent it from flowing into the engine. It also catches any metallic pieces that come from the engine wear. It is essential to keep the wear of all the internal parts of the engine to a minimum. It is attached to the engine block (monobloc), in front or next to the engine.</li><li><strong>Transmission fluid filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> Replace it or at least clean it every time you change the transmission fluid. In <strong>automatic cars</strong>, change it every <strong>25,000 miles</strong>, and in <strong>manual cars</strong> every <strong>50,000 miles</strong>.<strong></strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_transmision_aut.jpg\"></div> Purpose: They are commonly found in automatic transmission cars, since they catch any impurities created in them, preventing the wear and keeping the transmission working properly. They are located inside the transmission.</li><li><strong>Cabin air filter (or pollen filter)</strong>:   <strong></strong> They must usually be replaced every <strong>6,000 - 20,000 miles</strong>, depending on how dirty they are<strong>.</strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_de_habitaculo.jpg\"></div>Purpose: they catch any impurities brought by the air that enters the cabin due to the air conditioner. It stops dust and pollen particles, bugs, and plant remains. They are not really necessary for the car to work correctly, but they help the passengers feel more comfortable. They are placed inside of the ventilation duct, on the passenger seat’s side.</li></ul><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">⚠️ <strong>Warning</strong>: sometimes, the <strong>change periods vary a lot</strong> depending on how much dirt these filters have accumulated. For example, if you drive in areas where there is a lot of dust in the air, you will have to change the air and cabin filters more frequently than if you drive in a city. The same happens with fuel filters: if the fuel you use is not of good quality, it would be better to change it more frequently.</p><p>We have stated the standard periods to change these filters, but you should always change them according to the periods stated in your  124‘s  <a href=\"/abarth/124/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.</p><p>Please take into account that some filters are more important than others since they have an impact on the way the car works, but all of them <strong>should be checked periodically</strong> by you or by a specialist.</p>",

                        "<h2>What is the oxygen sensor (or lambda sensor) of your 124?</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In short:<br></strong>The oxygen sensor, also known as the <strong>lambda sensor</strong>, is in the exhaust system and <strong>measures the oxygen level in the exhaust gases</strong>. This information is later used by the central computer of your 124 (ECU or PCM) to control the fuel injection and allow the engine to work efficiently without wasting fuel or reducing its efficiency.</p><p>The exhaust system may have 1 or 2 oxygen sensors. The main one is in the inlet of the catalytic converter, and it monitors the gases that come out of the engine. The second one (if your car has one) is in the catalytic converter outlet, and its purpose is to monitor its performance. It is important to remember that if the catalytic converter malfunctions, extremely pollutant gases will be released into the atmosphere. The oxygen sensor usually begins to fail after the car has driven from <strong>55,000 to 90,000 miles (90,000 to 140,000 km), </strong>and that is when you should replace it. If it is working correctly, you do not have to replace it. Take into account that this is not an essential component with set maintenance periods, even if it helps your 124 work efficiently by reducing its emissions, and it also helps extend the engine lifespan. <strong>The oxygen sensor usually malfunctions when a lot of dirt has been accumulated </strong>due to the wrong fuel type or low-quality fuel usage. <strong>Most of the time </strong>you just need to clean it for it to go back to normal.</p><h2>Signs that show that your 124‘s oxygen sensor is faulty</h2><p>You will usually notice that the oxygen sensor is faulty when the <strong>idle speed is unstable</strong>, there is increased fuel consumption, and the <strong>check engine light</strong> comes on (you can see this light below). </p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/testigo_check_engine.png\"></div><p></p>",

This sensor is small, and its parts are immovable. It has a small hose that is placed in a hole that leads to the inside of the air circuit.</p><p>To function, the engine always tries to draw air in, but the butterfly valve blocks it partially. This creates a depression (a “negative” pressure) inside the intake manifold. It is like sucking the air in an empty plastic bottle. The faster the engine spins, and/or, the tighter this butterfly valve is closed, the bigger this depression will get. With this and some other pieces of information, the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) estimates the engine load (the burden placed on the engine) and adjusts the fuel injection to keep its optimal performance and minimize its fuel consumption.</p><h2>Signs that show that your 124‘s MAP sensor is faulty</h2><ul><li>The <em>Check engine</em> light comes on</li><li>Erratic speed: sometimes you cannot speed up, the acceleration may be slow, or your car may decelerate</li><li>Increased smoke emissions</li></ul><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️ <strong>Some other problems may cause symptoms similar to those of a faulty MAP sensor</strong>, for example, vacuum leaks.

If it gets dirty and the air does not flow through it anymore, the refrigerant will not cool, and the system will malfunction. It is not hard to notice the radiator is dirty. If that happens, you can clean it with a brush and fix the problem yourself.</li><li><strong>Damaged control valve: </strong><br>It is the valve that regulates the fluid flow that goes into the compressor. If the fluid does not get to the compressor, the pressure will not rise even if the compressor is spinning. These valves are cheap, so <strong>if you are looking for failure causes, you should first rule out this option before spending</strong> money on fixing other failures that may be more serious. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/valvula_control_ac.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Clogged filter dryer </strong>(it gets cold or becomes frozen):<br>You will notice the filter dryer is clogged if it feels too cold to the touch. In the worst-case scenario, it will be frozen. You will also notice that if you turn the air conditioner off and keep the pressure gauge connected, the pressure will take a lot of time to stabilize. In that case, you should replace the filter.<div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_secador.png\"></div></li><li><strong>The air conditioner compressor stopped working: </strong><br>The compressor may be damaged internally, or it may not even spin anymore.

If the pressure drops and the pressure is below the standard level, there is a <strong>leak</strong> in the system.<br><strong>If there is no such leak, </strong>you can<strong> fill the refrigerant.</strong><br>You can see where the leak is by coating the lines with soap. If you see bubbles, that is where the leak is located.</li><li><strong>Too much refrigerant in the air conditioner:</strong><br>The air conditioner radiator will be hotter than usual. The compressor will have trouble running, and it will consume more engine power. This may be caused by a human error when the refrigerant was filled. To solve this problem, you need to remove the excess refrigerant.<br></li><li><strong>Clogged expansion valve:</strong><br>If, according to the pressure gauge, the pressure levels are high but the evaporator is lukewarm, the air in the cabin will not cool.

                        "<h2>How does the air conditioner of your 124 work?</h2><p>The air conditioner circuit works thanks to the <strong>refrigerant</strong> that is inside.</p><p>The process to renew the air that enters the cabin may be divided into six basic phases:</p><ol type=\"1\"><li>When you turn the air conditioning system on, the <strong>compressor</strong> starts. This compressor raises the pressure of the refrigerant and makes it flow inside the system. The <strong>electric fan </strong>also turns on at its minimum speed. The electric fan is next to the condenser. Since it also cools the engine, it is placed next to the vehicle’s radiator.</li><li>The refrigerant flows through the <strong>condenser</strong>, which is a radiator placed next to the main engine radiator. Thanks to the air that flows into the engine, this refrigerant will cool and turn into liquid.</li><li>Then, it flows through a <strong>filter dryer</strong>. That is where any strange particles are removed, and any remaining bubbles left in the refrigerant are separated. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_secador.png\"></div></li><li>Afterward, this liquid continues its path to the <strong>expansion valve</strong>. This valve lowers the pressure of the liquid quickly and pulverizes it inside of the evaporator by abruptly lowering its temperature to -3 or -5°C (26 or 23°F).</li><li>The <strong>evaporator</strong> is a small radiator. Ambient air flows through it and, after it cools, it enters the cabin. The liquid inside of it becomes warm and then turns into gas.</li><li>This gas <strong>flows back into the compressor</strong> to be compressed again, and the cycle starts over.</li></ol><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/1bdfd930_Car-Air-Conditioning-System-.webp\"></div><p></p><p>The <strong>pressure switch</strong> can be found in the high-pressure circuit.

                        "<h2>What kind of transmission fluid does your 124 take?</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In short:</strong><br>The key is to choose the right <strong>quantity, quality,</strong> and <strong>type</strong> of lubricant you will use. There are <strong>manual transmission fluids </strong>and <strong>automatic transmission fluids.</strong></p><h2>Manual transmission fluid</h2><p>Manual transmission lubricants can be recognized because of their viscosity (their <strong>SAE number</strong>) and because of the <strong>API GL standards</strong> they must meet.</p><h2>The viscosity of the manual transmission fluid</h2><p>This information is usually found in the <a href=\"/abarth/124/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>. If there is an emergency and you do not know which transmission fluid you should use, you can use a SAE 75W-90 fluid, and your transmission will be safe until you can buy the right one.<strong></strong></p><p>Nowadays, there are almost no fluids with only one type of viscosity. Those fluids are called <strong>monograde</strong> oils. You can find monograde oils that go from SAE 75 to SAE 140.</p><p>You will usually find <strong>multigrade</strong> oils. Multigrade oils can flow as if they had 2 different viscosities since they can be exposed to both low and high temperatures. Because of this, the oil can flow efficiently in both cold and hot temperatures.</p><p>Here are some examples of multigrade oils: SAE 75W-80, SAE 75W-90, SAE 80W-90.</p><h2>API GL standards</h2><p> You can usually find this information in the <a href=\"/abarth/124/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>. If there is an emergency and you do not know which kind of oil you need, you can use a GL-4 oil until you can buy the right one.<strong></strong></p><p>Manual transmission fluids meet different API GL standards. The ones currently commercialized are <strong>API GL-4</strong> and <strong>API GL-5</strong> (the latter is not so common and does not work as a replacement for GL-4). These standards will indicate the properties of the lubricants and we should take them into account when we choose the oil we will use for a refill.</p><p>If the recommended standard for your 124 is GL-4, you should use a GL-4 oil; this way the bronze synchronizers of your transmission will not be ruined by the sulfur found in GL-5 oils.</p><h2>Automatic transmission fluid</h2><p>Automatic transmission fluids are usually called <strong>ATF.</strong> They are typically <strong>red or green </strong>to distinguish them from other types of oils.</p><p><strong></strong>You must always use the type of oil recommended in the owner’s manual of your 124. If there is an emergency and you do not know which oil you should use, you can use the following list as a guide.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p class=\"ArticleWarning\"><u>⚠</u><strong>  What happens if I do not use the recommended oil for my 124?</strong><br>Over time, <strong>the transmission may get damaged.</strong> You will not notice it right away, but you will surely see this after a few thousand miles. You may also notice that the car jerks when you change gears or that such gears feel stiff. If you have an automatic transmission, you may start feeling the clutch slipping when you accelerate.<br>Your car’s fuel consumption may also be increased due to using the wrong type of oil.</p><p>The ATF oils currently used are:</p><ul><li><strong>Dexron III</strong>: It was used until 2005. It was created for GM cars.</li><li><strong>Dexron VI</strong>: This product is the enhanced version of the Dexron III oil. It offers high thermal stability, an excellent performance even with low temperatures, and it is a great antioxidant.</li><li><strong>Mercon V</strong>: It was created especially for Ford cars since 1999.</li><li><strong>ATF+3, ATF+4</strong> (MS 7176 and MS 9602): They are mainly used for Jeep, Chrysler, and Dodge cars. The +3 fluid is oil-based, while the +4 fluid is synthetic. The ATF+4 can also be used in most Dodge, Plymouth, BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and Jeep cars.</li><li><strong>Highly Friction Modified ATF:</strong> This fluid is mainly recommended for Honda, Acura, Toyota, Jeep, Lexus, and Saturn cars with automatic transmission.</li><li><strong>SP-II, SP-III, SP-IV</strong>: These are special oil types for Mitsubishi’s automatic gearboxes.</li><li><strong>Toyota WS</strong> (World Spec): They are characterized by their low viscosity. They were developed for automatic Toyota cars.</li><li><strong>DSG fluids:</strong> They lubricate, trigger and refrigerate the gear components. They are called DCTF. They were created for DSG transmissions of multiple clutches immersed in oil.</li><li><strong>CVT fluids:</strong> These lubricants were designed for CVT transmissions.</li></ul>",

You should always use the kind of coolant indicated in the  <a href=\"/abarth/124/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>. Like this, your  124‘s engine will be thoroughly protected. If there is an emergency, you can use a coolant with glycol, no matter their color (they may be either green or pink). Afterward, when you have time, you can check the specific type of coolant your car needs.<strong></strong></p><h2><strong></strong><p></p></h2><h2>How do I prevent my 124 from overheating?</h2><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">There are some overheating causes that you can easily prevent yourself:<br><br><strong>-  Always use high-quality coolants:</strong> change the coolant every 30,000 miles (50,000 kilometers) or after 2 years. If you want to know more about this, you should read the  <a href=\"/abarth/124/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.<br><br><strong>- Never use water </strong>(either distilled or tap water): the coolant has certain qualities that are very important for the correct performance of the system. For example, it boils at a higher temperature.<br><br><strong>- Check the coolant level every 15 days: </strong>keep the coolant level up to the level indicated in the coolant reservoir.<br><br><strong>- Clean the radiator fins: </strong>the radiator may gather some garbage such as leaves, mud, or dust that clogs its airflow and its cooling qualities will decrease. Clean it with a brush every time you check the coolant level.</p><h2>Why does my 124‘s engine overheat?</h2><p>There are two main causes for engine overheat:</p><ol type=\"1\"><li>The coolant does not flow through the system like it should</li><li>There is not enough air flowing through the radiator</li></ol><p><em>⚠️ The coolant does not flow through the system like it should. These may be some of the causes:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Not enough coolant: </strong>check the coolant level periodically. If the level is under the minimum level recommended, the engine may overheat because there is not enough coolant.</li><li><strong>The pump may be worn out:</strong> it is advisable to change the pump every time you change the timing belt, since there is an excellent cost-benefit relationship.</li><li><strong>Clogged radiator: </strong>the internal tubes are small and, as time goes on, if the coolant is not refilled periodically, dirt accumulates and blocks these ducts.</li><li><strong>Clogged engine ducts:</strong> just like the previous item, but in the internal engine ducts.</li><li><strong>Thermostat not opening: </strong>thermostats usually become unresponsive because of the dirt or internal damage, which prevents the coolant from circulating through the radiator and cooling down.</li></ul><p><em>⚠️ There is not enough air flowing through the radiator. These may be some of the reasons:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Clogged radiator fins: </strong>the radiator may gather some garbage such as leaves, mud, or dust that clogs its air flow and its cooling qualities will decrease.</li><li><strong>Bent radiator fins: </strong>if you are not careful, you do not handle them carefully, or pressure-wash them, the fins will get bet until they block most of the airflow.</li><li><strong>The electric fan does not work:</strong> the electric fan might be damaged. If the temperature sensor or the control module are damaged, it may also stop working.</li></ul><p><em>⚠️ Other causes:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Poor-quality coolant:</strong> you should always use the coolant recommended in the owner’s manual, and renew it after the specified time period, which is usually every 5 years.</li><li><strong>Broken or loose radiator or reservoir cap: </strong>the cooling circuit must work while it is under pressure. If the caps are damaged or loose, this pressure and the liquid will leak.</li><li><strong>Not enough lubricant:</strong> when the friction between the internal pieces increase, the temperature and the wear increase significantly, and this may cause severe damages if it is not fixed on time.</li><li><strong>The cylinder heads may be broken: </strong>the combustion gases get into the refrigeration system, and this will increase the temperature and form gas bubbles.</li></ul><h2>How does the system that cools the engine of your 124 work?</h2><p>All engines have a cooling system, which works by taking the heat from the engine to the radiator.</p><p>This system is quite simple, and it includes the following parts:</p><ul><li>Coolant</li><li>Radiator</li><li>Coolant pump</li><li>Temperature sensor</li><li>Thermostat</li><li>Electric fan</li></ul><p>The engine cools thanks to the <strong>coolant</strong>, or “antifreeze.” You can usually buy it at gas stations when you “check the fluids.” It is typically green or pink. <strong>You must never use just water; this will damage the engine in a very short time period.</strong></p><p>You can see how this system works in the following image: the liquid takes the heat generated by the engine and takes it to the <strong>radiator</strong>. There is a <strong>pump </strong>that makes the liquid flow, and it pushes it along the circuit. The hot liquid enters through the upper part of the radiator, and it comes out being cool from the bottom part.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/bbb1b168_Sin título1.png\"></div><p></p><p>In order to keep its good performance, the engine of your 124 must always stay within the optimal temperature range, which is usually around 190ºF (90°C). To guarantee this temperature, the system has two “auxiliary” pieces that control temperatures: the thermostat and the electric fan. The <strong>thermostat </strong>prevents the coolant from cooling too much, and the <strong>electric fan</strong> stops it from heating.</p><p>The<strong> temperature sensor</strong> monitors the whole system that is usually controlled by the central computer or by a separate electronic module, depending on the car manufacturer.</p><p>Like in every system, any of these parts may malfunction or get damaged, and that will make the engine overheat, as we explained above.</p>",

Moreover, if the car has a diesel engine, this system will also block the “stop” relay, which will prevent the fuel from being injected into the engine. Sometimes, this system will also block the steering column which will lock the steering wheel.</p><h2>Why is the immobilizer activated on a 124?</h2><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">The main reason is because the car's computer does not recognize or does not detect the signal sent by the chip which is inside the key.

It will depend on how complex the electronic control unit of your 124 is.</p><p>To properly diagnose the failure of your 124, it is important <strong>to have a suitable scanner</strong> that is compatible with the brand and model of your car. The scanner will show <strong>the engine fault code </strong>that the computer has detected, which is related to a certain problem that is affecting the engine.</p><h2>The most common check engine light causes of your 124 and how to detect them</h2><ul><li>Ignition cylinder problems: irregular engine running.</li><li>Problem with exhaust gas oxygen sensor (Lambda probe): irregular engine running, there are misfires when accelerating abruptly or driving at low revs. It may be caused by a sensor fault or a failure of the catalytic converter.</li><li>Problems with the engine intake (air or fuel): engine running may be rough or irregular.</li><li>Problems with the electrical system: sometimes it is easy to identify the cause but other times it may take days of testing to find the source of the problem. </li><li>Sensor malfunction: It affects engine running or stops running completely. </li><li>Wiring problems: contact failure, cut wires, short circuits.</li></ul><h2>Indicator status and severity</h2><p>The check engine light can behave in different ways. Here we show you the most common light signals so you can know what is happening to your 124:</p><ul><li><strong>The light turns on when you switch on the ignition key and then it turns off</strong>: It’s normal. It’s used to verify that the light itself is working and the bulb is not burned out.</li><li><strong>The light blinks and then it turns off (cyclically)</strong>: This indicates that the car had a problem at one point but it is not happening at the moment.</li><li><strong>The light is steady:</strong> This indicates that there is a problem but is not so serious as to stop driving your vehicle.</li><li><strong>The light blinks continuously:</strong> This indicates that there is a critical problem. Usually, you should stop driving your vehicle. </li></ul><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">Keep in mind that if you have a <strong>top-quality scanner, you will be able to verify all the car sensors</strong>, avoiding blind maintenance which is a pointless waste of money.

And even if you can repair it, the cost will be extremely high.<br></p><p>This oil also “softens” friction between the different movable pieces of your car’s engine. It eliminates any direct contact between two surfaces in movement by creating a fluid layer among them. If this oil did not exist, these pieces would get worn out faster, and there would be so much heat created that the metals would melt and stick to each other, which would produce a lot of damage, most of it irreversible. This phenomenon is known as metal seizure.<br></p><p>Generally, good lubrication <strong>reduces engine wear and noise, and saves energy </strong>because of the diminished friction between different moving parts,<strong> and reduces maintenance costs.</strong><br></p><p>Their additives also have different roles, and they generally can be found altogether in motor oils:<br></p><ul><li><strong>They inhibit corrosion </strong>and prevent the engine from <strong>getting rusty</strong><br></li><li>They are dispersant: they <strong>prevent</strong> the dirt from forming any <strong>lumps,</strong> which may block any holes or become abrasive<br></li><li>They have a cleaning function: they <strong>clean</strong> the surfaces<br></li><li>They are <strong>defoamers</strong>: they prevent any air bubbles from creating<br></li><li>Their <strong>anti-friction</strong> properties reduce the friction between pieces even more<br></li><li>They work as <strong>antioxidants</strong>: they avoid the deterioration of the oil itself<br></li><li>They enhance viscosity: they allow the <strong>viscosity levels to stay high even at high temperatures</strong><br></li></ul>",

You will find the rest of specifications such as <strong>viscosity and quality</strong> in the <a href=\"/abarth/124/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> of your 124.</p><h2>What is oil viscosity and which is better for your 124?</h2><p>Viscosity is a <strong>measure of an oil’s resistance to flow</strong>: The thicker (higher viscosity) the oil, the slower it will flow and it will take more time to reach every part of the engine. It is commonly said that the oil is \"heavier\" when it is more viscous and \"lighter\" in the opposite case. Viscosity grades are measured based on SAE standards. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p>We advise you to look for the recommended viscosity in your <a href=\"/abarth/124/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> or ask your trusted mechanic. If you can’t find the information and you have to change the engine oil, this is what you have to know: </p><p>When engines work at low temperatures (engine start), the oil should be more fluid in order to reach every part of the engine and ensure immediate lubrication. After a few minutes, the temperature of the engine will rise and, ideally, the oil viscosity should be higher. This ensures proper lubrication without breaking the lubricant film. Nowadays, all oils meet this requirement and they are called <strong>multigrade oils </strong>(lower viscosity at cold temperatures and higher viscosity at hot temperatures).</p><p><strong>A medium viscosity level would be the SAE 10W-40 engine oil</strong>, which meet the needs of the current car models without difficulty.</p><p>If you live in a place where the temperature drops to 14° F (-10° C) or less you should use an oil with lower viscosity (5W-40 for example).<strong></strong></p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\"> ⚠️ If your vehicle has over 124,000 mi and consumes oil or you see some white smoke coming from the exhaust pipe, you can use an oil with a slightly higher viscosity to compensate for wear. </p><h2>Which engine oil should your 124 use?</h2><p><strong></strong>You can find the specific engine oil quality for your 124 in <strong>the Maintenance section </strong>of your <a href=\"/abarth/124/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.

Two of these anchors are placed in the seat base, and the other one is on top, called top tether.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/adeff0ae_Capture.PNG\"></div><p></p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/a805de99_Capture2.JPG\"></div><p></p><p>ISOFIX and LATCH are very similar. The main difference is that the former has rigid anchors, while the latter uses adjustable straps. <strong>Both reduce the probability of your children suffering severe injuries in a crash by 22%.</strong> None of these systems are approved to use with a seat heavier than 18 kilograms. That is to say, they are special anchors for groups 0, 0+, and 1.</p><p>Even if the <strong>biggest booster seats (group 2 and 3 or Boosters)</strong> may include ISOFIX or LATCH anchors, they will work as secondary anchors since <strong>the main anchor for them is the safety belt</strong>.</p><p>You should read the  <a href=\"/abarth/124/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> of your 124 to see if has certified anchors and what type they are.</p>",
                        "<h2> Exhaust smoke and its colors on a 124: causes and severity</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In a few words:</strong><br>According to the color of the exhaust smoke that is released from the exhaust pipe of your 124 you will be able to identify the possible causes. The colors of the exhaust smoke that your 124 may produce will help you find the problem. In <strong>order of priority </strong>from the least to the most dangerous, these colors are:<strong> white, blue, black, mix of two colors</strong>.</p><p>First, it should be said that the exhaust gas that is usually released through the exhaust pipe of your car is basically <strong>invisible</strong>. You should see a faint and short-lived exhaust that fades shortly after appearing only if you speed up abruptly. If your 124 discharges visible exhaust smoke then it is very likely that you need to take it to a specialist.</p><h2>White exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a 124</h2><p>The exhaust gas that comes out without strength and elevates considerably (it may get over the roof) but then fades without any trace when your car is idling may only be <strong>water vapor.</strong> This exhaust does not smell like anything in particular and it can be seen if the temperature is low or if there is humidity. <strong>If this is the case, do not worry.</strong></p><p><strong>If the white exhaust smoke does not fade, it is dense and smells, then</strong> it is associated with a <strong>coolant leak</strong>. In this case, the <strong>coolant level</strong> of your 124 <strong>should be low</strong>. Have your car checked up by a specialist to confirm this leak and prevent your engine from overheating.</p><p>⚠️<strong> Check the recovery tank. </strong>If you see that the <strong>coolant is bubbling</strong> that means that it is leaking into the combustion chamber. This is caused by a leak of exhaust gases into the cooling system. If your car has these symptoms <strong>you should</strong> <strong>have your engine checked</strong> by a specialist at once since this malfunction may bring serious problems.</p><p>This liquid leak may be caused by the following reasons:</p><ul><li>The cylinder head gasket is damaged (which is the cheapest problem to fix)</li><li>The cylinder head or the engine block are cracked (which is more expensive)</li></ul><h2>Blue exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a 124</h2><p>At first sight this exhaust smoke seems white but it has a <strong>blueish tone, a certain density and a particular smell, like something is burning. </strong>Moreover, its <strong>volume increases significantly when you step on the accelerator.</strong></p><p>This blue exhaust smoke indicates that the <strong>lubricant oil is burning</strong>, either because there is a leak into the inside of the combustion chamber or a leak into the exhaust system.</p><p>⚠️ <strong>Check if the level of lubricant oil</strong> of your 124 <strong>is decreasing drastically</strong> to verify if that is the cause.</p><p>The causes for this lubricant leak are usually the following:</p><ul><li><strong>The valve stem seals are in a bad shape</strong></li><li>The <strong>piston rings are worn down</strong></li><li>Leaks of oil in the supercharger (if the engine of you 124 has this system)</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, fixing any of these problems is expensive and they usually affect<strong> high mileage engines</strong> (with more than 90,000 miles) or cars with <strong>badly battered engines</strong>.</p><p><strong>If the exhaust smoke is blue but it is not too dense</strong>, it may be caused by a blockage in the crankcase ventilation system.</p><p>⚠️ In this case, <strong>the exhaust smoke will come from the engine and not from the exhaust pipe</strong>.</p><p>It is normal to see blueish exhaust coming from the exhaust pipe of mopeds and motorbikes with a two-stroke engine, and, in those cases, this exhaust is not caused by a failure.</p><h2>Black exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a 124</h2><p>This problem <strong>is usually seen in diesel engines</strong> and it is caused by a <strong>great increase in the amount of fuel supplied to the engine</strong>, that is to say, the engine is burning more fuel than it should.</p><p>⚠️ Check if the <strong>consumption of fuel</strong> of your 124 <strong>has increased significantly</strong>.<strong> You should also notice</strong> this because of <strong>the reduction of power </strong>of the engine.</p><p>You can also verify this flaw by <strong>putting a white cloth inside the exhaust pipe, clogging it up for a few seconds</strong>. This cloth will <strong>turn black</strong> instantly due to the expelled coal particles.</p><p>This black color is caused by the generation of hydrocarbons that are not completely burnt. They create more <strong>carbonaceous particles</strong> which soil the lubricant oil and they settle in each nook and cranny of the engine of your 124. At the same time, they are also accumulated inside the combustion chamber as hard crusts that are abrasive and wear down movable pieces.</p><p>The exhaust system is also affected because of the accumulation of cinder, which also poses a threat to the catalytic converter, the particle filter or the muffler of the car.</p><p>This problem may be caused by any of the following items:</p><ul><li>The air filter is too dirty.</li><li>The fuel injectors, the fuel pressure regulator, the throttle position sensor (TPS), or the Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor are dirty or there is an electrical flaw in them.</li><li>The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve is malfunctioning (this valve recirculates the exhaust gases back to the engine). When you accelerate, this EGR valve remains open so that the exhaust gases can get inside the engine once again.</li></ul><h2>Two-colored exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a 124</h2><p>In the worst case scenario the released exhaust will be two-colored. This means that there are many simultaneous causes for this problem and it is important that a specialist investigates this as soon as possible to prevent further failures.</p>",
                        "<h2>What do the technical specifications of your 124’s engine mean?</h2><p>Even though all engines are very similar when you look at them, there are many different types. We will now show you what the most usual technical specifications that you can find in the <strong>technical datasheet</strong> of your <strong> 124 </strong>mean.</p><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Gasoline or Diesel engines</strong><br><br>This is the main difference between engines. Engines that need Diesel have incandescent spark plugs that only work when the car starts. Once the engine is running, the fuel ignites by itself since it is compressed inside the cylinders thanks to the high temperature it reaches.<br>On the other hand, gasoline engines work thanks to the spark constantly created by the spark plugs. This means that they work all the time the engine is running.<br>Another difference between these two engines is that Diesel engines are generally heavier, and their structure is more robust.</li><li><strong>Number of cylinders</strong><br><br>It is the <strong>number</strong> of cylinders inside the engine. <strong>The engine power is generated </strong>in the cylinders because that is where the pistons are. For this reason, the more cylinders the engine has, the more its power will be. This also means that the engine will be bigger and heavier. It is also important to notice that if there are a lot of cylinders, the engine will consume more fuel. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/bloque.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Bore/stroke ratio</strong><br><br><strong>These are the piston’s measurements, </strong>and they can be expressed in centimeters or inches. They indicate the cylinder diameter (bore) and the longitudinal displacement (stroke) that the piston does inside the cylinder when the engine is running. These measurements allow us to measure the “displaced volume” by the piston. <strong>If the diameter is wide and the piston has a short stroke, the engine will be fit for sports cars.</strong> In other words, the revolutions per minute (RPMs) will be high.  <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/cf9931c1_carrera y diametro.png\"></div></li><li><strong>Engine displacement</strong><br><br>It is the total available volume in the engine cylinders. It is calculated by multiplying the stroke length, the bore, and the number of cylinders.<br>Depending on the country, it may be expressed in liters (1.6 L, 2.0 L, 3.6 L), or in cubic inches (98, 110, 250, 510 CI).<br>Generally, <strong>the higher the engine displacement is, the more power your car will have, but the higher its fuel consumption will be.</strong></li><li><strong>Cylinder arrangement</strong><br><br>a) In-line arrangement: nowadays, it is hard to find engines with more than 6 in-line cylinders because they take up too much space under the hood.<br><br>b) V-type arrangement: They are more compact and create fewer vibrations, but they can only be used with an even number of cylinders (V6, V8, V10, etc.).<br><br>c) Opposed arrangement: they are flat and not frequently used because their manufacture and maintenance are very demanding. Moreover, like the V-type arrangement, they can only be used with an even number of cylinders. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/tipo_de_motor.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Valvetrain type: SOHC and DOHC</strong><br><br>a) SOHC (single overhead camshaft):  It only has one camshaft placed in the cylinder head. Only one camshaft controls all the engine’s valves. They generally have more power if there are low RPMs. The camshaft is in charge of opening and closing the engine’s valves.<br>b) DOHC (double overhead camshaft): It has two camshafts placed in the cylinder head. One camshaft controls the admission valve while the other controls the escape valve. The performance of these engines is usually better if the RPMs are high. Moreover, its parts are usually lighter and can move faster.</li><li><strong>Compression ratio</strong><br><br><strong>It is the measurement of how much the volume of the air-fuel mixture can be compressed inside of the cylinder.</strong> The higher this number is, the higher the engine power will be. For example, if there is an 8:1 ratio, this means that the mixture will be reduced to one octave of its original volume.<br>Generally, compression ratios are between 8:1 and 12:1 for gasoline engines.</li><li><strong>Naturally aspirated or turbo engines</strong><br><br>A <strong>naturally aspired</strong> engine means <strong>that the engine draws air directly through an air intake.</strong> In turbocharged cars, on the other hand,<strong> the turbocharger injects air by forcing it into the engine.</strong> The advantage of using turbochargers is that, in small engines, the power increases because it is possible to inject more air and fuel into the cylinders.</li><li><strong> Torque</strong><br><br><strong>It is the “strength” that the engine has when it accelerates.</strong><br>It is measured in “foot-pounds” or in “N.m” (1 N.m = 0.737 ft.lb), and to express it, the RPM of the engine must also be stated. For example: 150 N.m @ 1700 RPM.<br>Off-road cars usually have a lot of torque and not so much power. This enables them to drive up big slopes at a slow speed or dodge big pits and rocks. Diesel engines have more torque than gasoline engines.</li><li><strong> Power</strong><br><br><strong>It is the car’s ability to accelerate (to react) at high speeds.</strong><br>It is measured in HP (Horse Power), or in KW (1 HP = 0.745 KW).</li><li><strong> Revolutions per minute (RPM)</strong><br><br><strong>They represent the engine speed. It is important to distinguish them from the car speed since they are not the same thing.</strong> Both are related by the transmission. For example, if the car is in neutral gear and we press the accelerator, we may only change the engine speed but not the car speed.<br>Technically speaking: <em>Torque x RPM = Power</em><br>In a car, the RPM are controlled by the accelerator. Their rise depends on how much we press the accelerator, and this will be reflected in the tachometer. The higher the RPMs are, the noisier the engine will be.</li></ol>",

They are cheap, disposable and there are <strong>different types</strong> according to their usage and the amount of <strong>amperage</strong> they transmit.<br>There are Bosch fuses (or torpedo or GCB), cylinder fuses (or cartridge) made of glass, blade (or spade) fuses, cartridge fuses (JSCASE and MCASE), and high current fuses. The same car may have up to 3 types of fuses for its different circuits.</p><p>Fuses are pieces that <strong>protect the electrical circuits</strong>. That is to say, every time an electrical component of your 124 <strong>suddenly stops working</strong>, there might be a <strong>blown fuse</strong>. The good news is that fuses are really <strong>cheap and easy to replace</strong>. For this reason, before you mourn the loss of your stereo, air conditioner, or other devices, you should first check these little pieces.</p><p>All of them work in the same way and, the other good news is that they have no front or backside, so they are <strong>easy to put into place</strong>. Despite their small size, they have a <strong>calibrated conductor for the highest current they can withstand</strong>, and if the current goes over this value, the conductor breaks, which interrupts the circuit and makes it impossible for the current to keep on flowing. The visible result is that the system stops working, but it is just because there is no current, not because of a serious problem.</p><p>Each type of fuse has a <strong>normalized value </strong>that can be easily recognizable because it is <strong>engraved in its body</strong>.</p><p>You can see where the fuse box of your 124 is located and what each fuse protects in the <a href=\"/abarth/124/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.</p><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️Every time you change a fuse, you should do it while your 124 is turned off.</p><h2>Fuse types</h2><p>There are many fuse types, but these are the most common in the automotive industry:</p><p><strong>Blade (or spade) fuses:</strong></p><p>They are used in vehicles manufactured since the year 2000 up to now.</p><p>They have a rectangular shape, a flat contour, and a plastic, transparent body.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/e69d5b39_500px-Electrical_fuses,_blade_type.svg.png\"></div><p></p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\"><strong>There are many different sizes:</strong><br><br>Micro2 (APT - ATR)  -  with 5 to 30 amperes.<br>Micro3 (ATL)  -  with 5 to 15 amperes.<br>Low profile Mini (APS), wrongly known as \"micro\" - with 2 to 30 amperes.<br>Mini (ATM - APM) - their ends are smaller than those of Micro2 fuses -  with 2 to 30 amperes.<br>High/Regular/Standard - with 0.5 to 40 amperes.<br>Maxi (APX) - with 20 to 120 amperes.</p><p><strong>Cartridge fuses (JCASE and MCASE):</strong></p><p>They usually have a female connector, but there are also male ones.

                        "<h2>How to keep your 124 safe during extended periods without use</h2><p>If your 124 has to stay in one place for a long time, here are some recommendations to keep your car in the best possible condition.</p><p><strong>Battery:</strong> Disconnect the negative terminal of the battery. This will prevent the electrical components from consuming it, and it will prevent any future problems when you start your 124.</p><p><strong>Tires: </strong>Inflate your car’s tires with more pressure than the recommended one for driving. Either 3 or 4 psi should be enough. Like this, they will not get deformed when they naturally deflate.</p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">If you will not use your 124 for a few months, you can also create some sort of support with bricks (or any other elements) and place it under the chassis so that it can help the wheels hold the weight of the car when the wheels deflate.</p><p><strong>Fuel:</strong> Ideally, the fuel tank should be full. If there is less air inside of the tank, there is less probability of it evaporating. Additionally, like this, if the tank is metallic, you will prevent its rusting.</p><p><strong>Hand brake:</strong> You must never activate it unless it is really necessary. It has a wire in its mechanism, and if this wire stays taut for a long period, it may get damaged. Also the brake pad (brake shoe) may get stuck or corrode the pieces it is in contact with.</p><p><strong>Fluids and oils:</strong> Check that the levels of refrigerant, steering fluid, brake fluid, and oil of your 124 are the recommended ones.</p><p><strong>Start:</strong> If you can, start your 124 once every ten days. This will prevent the wear of the mechanical pieces of the engine, and it will recharge the battery. During those moments, you should also turn the air conditioner on, move the automatic windows and turn all the lights on and off. The movement of the circuits will keep your car in good shape.</p><p><strong>Exhaust pipe: </strong>Put a small cloth with motor oil in the external part of the exhaust pipe to prevent corrosion.</p><p><strong>Cleaning: </strong>Prevent bad smells and mold in the car by cleaning the inside of the car thoroughly. You may also leave some carbon or a cup with dry rice inside so that they will absorb humidity.</p><p>To keep the outside of the car clean, you can wax your car and then cover it with a car tarpaulin.</p><p></p>",
                        "<h2>What light bulbs fit your 124?</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In short:</strong><br>If one of your 124‘s bulbs burned out and you want to know which one you should buy to replace it, you can remove it and take it to an auto part store, or you can check the maintenance section found in the <a href=\"/abarth/124/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.<br>If you replaced the bulb but it is still not working, you should check the fuses.</p><p>Your 124 has bulbs that illuminate both the outside and the inside of the car. Since headlamps are more complex, there are many types. They are the ones that illuminate the road ahead without dazzling the other drivers. Brake lights are only there to be seen at a sensible distance by the drivers behind you, and their purpose is to light up when you press the brake pedal.</p><p><strong>Generally, changing these bulbs is easy,</strong> and you can do it yourself. Cars have a different lighting system from that of a house since they are guaranteed to keep working despite the vehicle’s vibrations. You only have to make sure that their <strong>pigtail wire has been properly connected</strong>. You will know they have been connected properly because <strong>there is only one way they can be connected</strong>.</p><p>You should <strong>have a spare bulb in your 124</strong> if you are about to go on a road trip. Even if <strong>a bulb has a lifespan of several years</strong>, they are cheap and it never hurts to be careful.</p><ul><li><strong>LED lamps</strong></li></ul><p>The main advantage of LED lamps is their <strong>efficiency</strong>: they produce <strong>a lot of light,</strong> and they <strong>draw less electrical energy (</strong>up to 80% less<strong>)</strong>. Moreover, their <strong>lifespan is 25 times longer</strong> than the lifespan of a halogen lamp. LED lamps are <strong>instantly on</strong> and, since the component that produces light is relatively small, these lamps can be created in any shape or form. They are made of semiconductor materials enclosed in a small, plastic shell and only one lamp may produce different colors.</p><p>There are a lot of high-end brands that use LED technology for their products, but their usage of fixed LED light panels makes it almost impossible for them to be changed without having to visit an authorized car dealer.</p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/0af84ef3_Untitled4-628x280.png\"></div><p></p><ul><li><strong>Incandescent lamps</strong></li></ul><p>They are the <strong>oldest ones, they consume a lot of energy and create a lot of heat.</strong> They are made up of a metallic filament which is protected by a transparent glass bulb. When the electricity goes through the filament, it turns bright red and it produces light. Nowadays, these lamps are still used to illuminate <strong>car interiors, dashboard lights, brake lights, direction-indicator lights, and front position lights</strong>, since these lights do not need to be too powerful. They have different watts, sizes, and shapes according to their usage. They may have 1 or 2 filaments (just like the brake lights).</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/e7ba5170_Incandenscentes.jpg\"></div><p></p><ul><li><strong>Halogen lamps</strong></li></ul><p><strong>They are the enhanced version of incandescent lamps.</strong> <strong>The light they produce is stronger and whiter.</strong> They work the same way; the only difference is that the glass bulb encloses halogen gas, which improves the filament’s output and, therefore, also enhances its lifespan. For these reasons, these lamps are more efficient, and small halogen lamps may be powerful.</p><p>These lamps may have <strong>different</strong> amounts of filaments, their filaments may be placed in different positions, and the shape of their bulbs may be different. The most common ones are these: </p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/412a152f_Halógenas2.jpg\"></div><p></p><p><strong>H1 lamps</strong>: <strong>They are used in fog lamps and high beam lights.</strong> They only have one filament placed longitudinally and they have a compact shape. There are 55, 70 and, 100-W H1 lamps.</p><p><strong>H3 lamps</strong>: They are usually used in <strong>fog lamps and long-range lights</strong>, and they have only one filament, which is placed transversely. They are the most compact ones. They only include a small wire to connect them. There are 55, 70 and 100-W H3 lamps.</p><p><strong>H4 lamps</strong>: They are the most used in <strong>headlamps because they can also be used as dipped beam headlights and high beam lights, which saves space.</strong> They have two filaments, and they are bigger than the other types of lamps. There are usually 55/60, 70/75, and 90/100-W H4 lamps (for crossings/highways).</p><p><strong>H7 lamps</strong>: They are mainly used in <strong>fog lamps</strong>. They only have one linear filament, and they are somewhat bigger than H1 and H3 lamps.</p><ul><li><strong>Xenon lamps</strong></li></ul><p><strong>They are the brightest ones,</strong> and the light they produce is whiter than the one made by halogen lamps. Their downside is that the electrical energy needed to turn these lamps on must be high (30,000 V). Their arc needs a high current, so they need auxiliary equipment called reactance, which is in charge of controlling the electrical energy of the lamp. If you are thinking of switching to Xenon’s lamps, an auto mechanic should do it for you.</p><p><strong>These lights take one minute to reach their maximum power.</strong> The good thing is that once you turn these lights on, they <strong>consume less electricity than halogen lamps</strong>, <strong>generate less heat and their lifespan is way longer.</strong> They are <strong>more expensive</strong> than the other lamps.</p><p>Regarding their structure, they do not have filaments. They have two electrodes, separated by a few millimeters protected by a glass bulb where there is high-pressure Xenon gas. An electrical arc that produces light is created between these two electrodes. You can see this light in the following image.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/5f306ae3_xenon-lampara3.jpg\"></div><p></p>",

This happens inside of the cylinders, and the <strong>spark plugs</strong> are the ones that create it.</p><p>Spark plugs are only used in Otto cycle engines, which are usually called “gasoline” engines. This means that Diesel cars do not have spark plugs.</p><p>It is common for engines to have just one spark plug per cylinder. They are screwed into the lid, called cylinder head, and there is one part of them inside, and its connector is outside. They are connected to the ignition coil through a thick wire with a cap on its cover, as seen in the image below. </p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/cable_bujia.jpg\"></div><p></p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/bujia2.jpg\"></div><p></p><p>The ignition coil creates the high current necessary for the spark plug, which makes the spark that starts the fuel ignition process.

When there are more electrodes, they deteriorate less.</li><li><strong>Heat rating: </strong>this value indicates how much heat the spark plug dissipates. If it does not dissipate a lot of heat, the fuel may self-ignite itself, and this will affect both the performance and the autonomy of the car. This number can be found in spark plugs under their brandmark<div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/c885ad6d_image.png\"></div></li><li><strong>Calibration: </strong>distance “d” between the central electrode and the earth electrode.

That’s why in your car’s chart you can find any of them. Take  the machine that you will use for the measurements and <strong>check which unit it uses  and ​consider only that data in the tag​.</strong> The other data  will be the equivalent in other  units, so you don’t need to use it.</p><h2>When shall I check the pressure of the tires of my 124? </h2><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">⚠   <strong>We recommend you to check the pressure of the tires once every 15 days​</strong> and every time you are  about to start a long trip. You must do this measurement<strong> with ​cold tires for it to be precise. </strong>​Meaning,  don’t do it in the middle of a long journey because you will probably get a useless reading. Keep in mind that, while running, the tires get naturally deformed, by producing heat and absorbing the heat  from the road. The temperature rise makes ​the pressure to rise​ as well and then we might get higher values than we should in the measurement. </p><h2>Why is it important to respect the recommended pressure in your 124? </h2><p>The tires’ pressure was well studied by the manufacturers in order to guarantee: </p><ul><li> <strong>Security​: </strong>it improves the maneuverability and the stability and reduces the  braking. Also, it reduces the temperature of the tires, lessening the  chances of having punctures. </li><li> <strong>Fuel efficiency​: </strong>tires with the appropriate pressure generate less  resistance for the wheels and will therefore spend less fuel, contributing  both to saving money and with the environment.</li><li><strong> Reduces tire erosion: </strong>​the tires will be deformed less and will be less  mechanically demanded. In consequence, they will have longer life time. On top of this, the tire’s erosion will be even in the whole tire.<strong>Comfort​</strong>: you will feel that your car is more stable and will feel less the  potential irregularities of the road (because you will have better shock  absorbency). </li></ul><h2>Erosion according with the tire inflation level on a 124 </h2><p>The correct tire inflation level ensures that the tires’ footprint is optimal.

Going back to a harder surface, you will need to  pump up the tires again for not damaging them.</li><li> <strong>To reduce fuel’s consumption:</strong> ​one can rise in 3 or 4 pounds the  pressure while circulating in a city. The other side of the coin of this tip is  that you will feel the irregularities of the road much more, you will have a worse ground attachment and you will have more erosion of the tire in its central area.  </li></ul><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠  An important recommendation: while  circulating in wet grounds​ (such as the ones you find on a rainy day), it is key to keep the adequate pressure, recommended by the manufacturer; because it will  guarantee you better adherence to the ground and therefore you will avoid accidents.  </p>",

The two of them are derived from petroleum, and they are formed by hydrocarbons (hydrogen and carbon molecules).</p><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️  <strong>The main rule is that you must only use diesel in Diesel engines and gasoline in spark-ignition engines </strong>(called “Otto cycle engines”).<strong> Otherwise, the engine of your 124 may get ruined.</strong></p><p>To obtain energy from fuel, it must be burning: in a Diesel engine, the diesel burns because of the compression, and in an Otto cycle engine, it burns by a spark created by the spark plug. For this reason, each type of fuel has different characteristics: diesel is more oily and takes longer to burn, while gasoline is more volatile and burns a lot faster.</p><p>Diesel engines are more efficient than Otto engines, but their exhaust smoke is more contaminant. For this reason, they have to go through certain processes to comply with the pollution prevention laws, and that makes them more expensive.</p><p><strong>Natural gas </strong>is the third type of fuel, and it is mainly used in Latin-American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. To use it, many modifications should be made to the fuel system of the car, and a certified company should do it. This type of fuel makes the car have less autonomy than the other ones, so the engine’s performance may not be ideal, but since it is <strong>a lot cheaper</strong>, it is also popular.</p><p>There are two other types of fuel that are massively used: <strong>biodiesel </strong>and <strong>ethanol</strong> (ethylic alcohol).

Take advantage of the “engine braking” by letting the car stop on its own. In this way fuel consumption will decrease A LOT.</li><li><strong>Speed</strong>: the higher the speed, the greater the power needed. <strong>On highways, the optimal speed is of 60 mph with the car set in its highest gear.</strong> If we take into account the laws of physics, doubling the speed means increasing the power 8 times.</li><li><strong>Air conditioner</strong>: Always use the air conditioner in <strong>“recirculation” mode</strong>. Air conditioning consumes quite a lot of the engine's energy. Cooling the air inside the cabin is a lot easier than cooling the air coming from outside constantly. On the other hand, as the air conditioner compressor is usually mechanically connected to the engine, if there are more engine revolutions the energy consumption will increase.</li><li><strong>Tire pressure</strong>: it is important that your tires have the<strong> pressure indicated</strong> by the manufacturer, both to have minimal fuel consumption as well as for security, to preserve the tires in optimal conditions with minimal wear. To know the recommended pressure for your tires you can read our <a class=\"\" href=\"/abarth/124/guides/tire-pressure\">\n                <span class=\"\">tire pressure guide.</span>\n              </a></li><li><strong>Rolled down car windows</strong>: if the windows are rolled down the aerodynamics of the car will be reduced and aerodynamics play an important role when going at <strong>more than 45 mph</strong>, when air resistance increases considerably.</li><li> <strong>Electrical consumption</strong>: it may be caused because <strong>more lights </strong>were added or because the <strong>sound</strong> system was upgraded to a more powerful one. This consumes more of the battery's electricity, which at the same time will need more of the alternator's supply, which will eventually consume more of the engine's power.</li></ol><h2>Issues of your 124 which increase fuel consumption</h2><ul><li><strong>Tight brakes</strong>: If you feel that your car subtly brakes all the time, you should take it to a mechanic so that they can <strong>clean and adjust the brakes</strong>. If you don't do this, you will accelerate more than you want just to maintain a specific speed.</li><li><strong>Defective battery</strong>: a defective battery lowers its efficiency and makes it require more electrical power from the alternator (which, in turn, consumes more of the engine's power).</li><li><strong>Clogged up air filter</strong>: this decreases combustion efficiency and more fuel is required to achieve the same power.</li><li><strong>Damaged spark plugs and/or spark plugs' wires</strong>: the spark of the spark plugs is weaker than usual and the fuel burns in an incomplete manner, for which reason more fuel is needed to achieve the same power (or speed).</li><li><strong>Defective ignition coil</strong>: this is just like the previous item, but you should notice this problem when you drive, as the engine works in a “mismatched” manner; you can feel vibrations, your car suddenly stops or it jerks when you accelerate or drive at a constant speed.</li><li><strong>Leaks in the fuel circuit</strong>: You can identify them if you perceive a constant gasoline <strong>smell</strong>.</li><li><strong>Dirty or damaged injectors</strong>: they may lead to the leak of small quantities of fuel when it is not necessary, even with the engine stopped. This may also damage the exhaust system of the engine as the waste is accumulated.</li><li><strong>Dirty or damaged fuel filter</strong>: it allows the filth to go through, which damages the injectors.</li><li><strong>Faulty oxygen sensor (Lambda probe)</strong>: it indicates incorrect oxygen values which makes the air and the fuel mix inadequately and this increases fuel consumption.</li><li> <strong>Faulty mass air flow sensor</strong>: this electronic management system has no way of knowing clearly how much air is actually going inside the engine, and for this reason this mixture becomes inefficient, as well as the combustion.</li></ul><p>You can check fuel consumption by paying attention to the <strong><em>instantaneous consumption</em></strong> and the <strong><em>average consumption</em></strong>, which can be verified in cars with an on-board computer. The first one will give you a reference to evaluate in which cases your car consumes the lowest amount of fuel so as to repeat these scenarios, and the second one will give you a value to compare with the values of other users to check if your car’s fuel consumption is average or if your car has <strong>any of the problems mentioned</strong> in the previous section.</p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\"> <strong>✔️</strong> <strong>Recommendations if you want to buy a car with good fuel economy:</strong><br><br><strong>1 - </strong>Choose small cars with small engines.<br><strong>2 - </strong>It is important that these cars do not have a “square” shape, their body should be more aerodynamic.<br><strong>3 - </strong>Look up information about fuel consumption declared by their manufacturers and other users so that you can compare them.</p>",

If the engine is on, you should turn it off and let it rest for at least 5 minutes so that its electric charge stabilizes. In both cases, you should turn the headlamps on for 30 seconds and then turn them off. This will get rid of small voltages which may produce wrong readings.</li><li><strong>Get the multimeter ready: </strong>To adjust the multimeter you must turn the selector up to the option that reads 20 V. In that way, it will be placed in the measurement scope you need.</li><li><strong>Measure your 124‘s battery while the engine is off: </strong>After you turn the multimeter on, connect the red probe to the positive terminal (+) of the battery, which is usually marked in red color too, and then connect the <strong>black probe</strong> to the negative terminal (-).

It is located in the middle of the steering wheel, and it is the most common one.</li><li><strong>Front passenger airbag: </strong>it is like the airbag for driver, but located inside of the glove box.</li><li><strong>Knee airbags: </strong>they protect the driver and the passenger from any leg and calf injuries. They are placed under the steering wheel and the glove box.</li><li><strong>Side airbags: </strong>they protect the passengers in case of side collisions by preventing their bodies from crashing into the car. They may be inside of the seats or inside of the bodywork.</li><li><strong>Curtain airbags: </strong>they protect the passengers in case of side collisions. They are mounted in the roof above the side doors and, when they activate, they cover the internal side of the cabin, both the front and the back seats. They diminish the collision with the bodywork and protect passengers from getting hurt by broken window glass.</li><li><strong>Rear airbags:</strong> They protect the heads of rear passengers. You can usually find them in compact cars. They cover the rear window in case of a collision.</li></ul><p><strong>External airbags:</strong></p><p>These airbags activate outside of the bodywork.

Almost all of them work in the same way: the fluid goes through one or more sheets of porous paper in which these impurities are caught.</p><p><strong>⚠️ There is one main problem with filters:</strong></p><p>As time goes on, particles are accumulated in the filters and <strong>overload</strong> them, so the fluids (either fuel, air, or oil) cannot flow through them anymore. When this happens, we say that <strong>the filter is “clogged.”</strong></p><h2>When should you change the filters of your 500?</h2><ul><li><strong>Air filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> They must usually be replaced every <strong>7,000 miles.</strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_aire_admision.jpg\"></div>Purpose: they purify the air that gets into the cylinders. It catches any impurities that may be in the air, such as dirt, sand, plant remains, bugs, etc. It is essential to keep the internal surfaces of both cylinders and piston rings clean, which also diminishes their wear.  It is found inside the engine compartment, inside of a plastic black box (air cleaner case).</li><li><strong>Fuel filter</strong>:   <strong></strong>Fuel filters should be replaced <strong>every 10,000 miles or once a year</strong>. Diesel filters usually last longer, so it is advisable to change them after <strong>30,000 miles</strong>. <strong></strong><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_de_combustible.png\"></div>Purpose: it catches all the impurities in the fuel that may come from the fuel tank. It prevents the injectors, as well as some other parts of the fuel feed system, from getting dirty. In Diesel cars, they also catch the water that may be in the fuel.This filter is usually close to the fuel tank in gasoline cars, and you can access it right under it. On the other hand, in Diesel cars, this filter is placed inside the engine compartment.</li><li><strong>Motor oil filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> They must usually be replaced <strong>every 5,000 - 10,000 miles (when you change the oil).</strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_aceite.jpg\"></div>Purpose: one of the purposes of the motor oil is to clean the engine and prevent dirt from sticking into metallic surfaces. The dirt transported by the oil is caught in the filter to prevent it from flowing into the engine. It also catches any metallic pieces that come from the engine wear. It is essential to keep the wear of all the internal parts of the engine to a minimum. It is attached to the engine block (monobloc), in front or next to the engine.</li><li><strong>Transmission fluid filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> Replace it or at least clean it every time you change the transmission fluid.

This information is later used by the central computer of your 500 (ECU or PCM) to control the fuel injection and allow the engine to work efficiently without wasting fuel or reducing its efficiency.</p><p>The exhaust system may have 1 or 2 oxygen sensors. The main one is in the inlet of the catalytic converter, and it monitors the gases that come out of the engine. The second one (if your car has one) is in the catalytic converter outlet, and its purpose is to monitor its performance. It is important to remember that if the catalytic converter malfunctions, extremely pollutant gases will be released into the atmosphere.

                        "<h2>What kind of transmission fluid does your 500 take?</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In short:</strong><br>The key is to choose the right <strong>quantity, quality,</strong> and <strong>type</strong> of lubricant you will use. There are <strong>manual transmission fluids </strong>and <strong>automatic transmission fluids.</strong></p><h2>Manual transmission fluid</h2><p>Manual transmission lubricants can be recognized because of their viscosity (their <strong>SAE number</strong>) and because of the <strong>API GL standards</strong> they must meet.</p><h2>The viscosity of the manual transmission fluid</h2><p>This information is usually found in the <a href=\"/abarth/500/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>. If there is an emergency and you do not know which transmission fluid you should use, you can use a SAE 75W-90 fluid, and your transmission will be safe until you can buy the right one.<strong></strong></p><p>Nowadays, there are almost no fluids with only one type of viscosity. Those fluids are called <strong>monograde</strong> oils. You can find monograde oils that go from SAE 75 to SAE 140.</p><p>You will usually find <strong>multigrade</strong> oils. Multigrade oils can flow as if they had 2 different viscosities since they can be exposed to both low and high temperatures. Because of this, the oil can flow efficiently in both cold and hot temperatures.</p><p>Here are some examples of multigrade oils: SAE 75W-80, SAE 75W-90, SAE 80W-90.</p><h2>API GL standards</h2><p> You can usually find this information in the <a href=\"/abarth/500/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>. If there is an emergency and you do not know which kind of oil you need, you can use a GL-4 oil until you can buy the right one.<strong></strong></p><p>Manual transmission fluids meet different API GL standards. The ones currently commercialized are <strong>API GL-4</strong> and <strong>API GL-5</strong> (the latter is not so common and does not work as a replacement for GL-4). These standards will indicate the properties of the lubricants and we should take them into account when we choose the oil we will use for a refill.</p><p>If the recommended standard for your 500 is GL-4, you should use a GL-4 oil; this way the bronze synchronizers of your transmission will not be ruined by the sulfur found in GL-5 oils.</p><h2>Automatic transmission fluid</h2><p>Automatic transmission fluids are usually called <strong>ATF.</strong> They are typically <strong>red or green </strong>to distinguish them from other types of oils.</p><p><strong></strong>You must always use the type of oil recommended in the owner’s manual of your 500. If there is an emergency and you do not know which oil you should use, you can use the following list as a guide.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p class=\"ArticleWarning\"><u>⚠</u><strong>  What happens if I do not use the recommended oil for my 500?</strong><br>Over time, <strong>the transmission may get damaged.</strong> You will not notice it right away, but you will surely see this after a few thousand miles. You may also notice that the car jerks when you change gears or that such gears feel stiff. If you have an automatic transmission, you may start feeling the clutch slipping when you accelerate.<br>Your car’s fuel consumption may also be increased due to using the wrong type of oil.</p><p>The ATF oils currently used are:</p><ul><li><strong>Dexron III</strong>: It was used until 2005. It was created for GM cars.</li><li><strong>Dexron VI</strong>: This product is the enhanced version of the Dexron III oil. It offers high thermal stability, an excellent performance even with low temperatures, and it is a great antioxidant.</li><li><strong>Mercon V</strong>: It was created especially for Ford cars since 1999.</li><li><strong>ATF+3, ATF+4</strong> (MS 7176 and MS 9602): They are mainly used for Jeep, Chrysler, and Dodge cars. The +3 fluid is oil-based, while the +4 fluid is synthetic. The ATF+4 can also be used in most Dodge, Plymouth, BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, and Jeep cars.</li><li><strong>Highly Friction Modified ATF:</strong> This fluid is mainly recommended for Honda, Acura, Toyota, Jeep, Lexus, and Saturn cars with automatic transmission.</li><li><strong>SP-II, SP-III, SP-IV</strong>: These are special oil types for Mitsubishi’s automatic gearboxes.</li><li><strong>Toyota WS</strong> (World Spec): They are characterized by their low viscosity. They were developed for automatic Toyota cars.</li><li><strong>DSG fluids:</strong> They lubricate, trigger and refrigerate the gear components. They are called DCTF.

You should always use the kind of coolant indicated in the  <a href=\"/abarth/500/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>. Like this, your  500‘s engine will be thoroughly protected. If there is an emergency, you can use a coolant with glycol, no matter their color (they may be either green or pink). Afterward, when you have time, you can check the specific type of coolant your car needs.<strong></strong></p><h2><strong></strong><p></p></h2><h2>How do I prevent my 500 from overheating?</h2><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">There are some overheating causes that you can easily prevent yourself:<br><br><strong>-  Always use high-quality coolants:</strong> change the coolant every 30,000 miles (50,000 kilometers) or after 2 years. If you want to know more about this, you should read the  <a href=\"/abarth/500/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.<br><br><strong>- Never use water </strong>(either distilled or tap water): the coolant has certain qualities that are very important for the correct performance of the system. For example, it boils at a higher temperature.<br><br><strong>- Check the coolant level every 15 days: </strong>keep the coolant level up to the level indicated in the coolant reservoir.<br><br><strong>- Clean the radiator fins: </strong>the radiator may gather some garbage such as leaves, mud, or dust that clogs its airflow and its cooling qualities will decrease. Clean it with a brush every time you check the coolant level.</p><h2>Why does my 500‘s engine overheat?</h2><p>There are two main causes for engine overheat:</p><ol type=\"1\"><li>The coolant does not flow through the system like it should</li><li>There is not enough air flowing through the radiator</li></ol><p><em>⚠️ The coolant does not flow through the system like it should. These may be some of the causes:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Not enough coolant: </strong>check the coolant level periodically. If the level is under the minimum level recommended, the engine may overheat because there is not enough coolant.</li><li><strong>The pump may be worn out:</strong> it is advisable to change the pump every time you change the timing belt, since there is an excellent cost-benefit relationship.</li><li><strong>Clogged radiator: </strong>the internal tubes are small and, as time goes on, if the coolant is not refilled periodically, dirt accumulates and blocks these ducts.</li><li><strong>Clogged engine ducts:</strong> just like the previous item, but in the internal engine ducts.</li><li><strong>Thermostat not opening: </strong>thermostats usually become unresponsive because of the dirt or internal damage, which prevents the coolant from circulating through the radiator and cooling down.</li></ul><p><em>⚠️ There is not enough air flowing through the radiator. These may be some of the reasons:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Clogged radiator fins: </strong>the radiator may gather some garbage such as leaves, mud, or dust that clogs its air flow and its cooling qualities will decrease.</li><li><strong>Bent radiator fins: </strong>if you are not careful, you do not handle them carefully, or pressure-wash them, the fins will get bet until they block most of the airflow.</li><li><strong>The electric fan does not work:</strong> the electric fan might be damaged. If the temperature sensor or the control module are damaged, it may also stop working.</li></ul><p><em>⚠️ Other causes:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Poor-quality coolant:</strong> you should always use the coolant recommended in the owner’s manual, and renew it after the specified time period, which is usually every 5 years.</li><li><strong>Broken or loose radiator or reservoir cap: </strong>the cooling circuit must work while it is under pressure. If the caps are damaged or loose, this pressure and the liquid will leak.</li><li><strong>Not enough lubricant:</strong> when the friction between the internal pieces increase, the temperature and the wear increase significantly, and this may cause severe damages if it is not fixed on time.</li><li><strong>The cylinder heads may be broken: </strong>the combustion gases get into the refrigeration system, and this will increase the temperature and form gas bubbles.</li></ul><h2>How does the system that cools the engine of your 500 work?</h2><p>All engines have a cooling system, which works by taking the heat from the engine to the radiator.</p><p>This system is quite simple, and it includes the following parts:</p><ul><li>Coolant</li><li>Radiator</li><li>Coolant pump</li><li>Temperature sensor</li><li>Thermostat</li><li>Electric fan</li></ul><p>The engine cools thanks to the <strong>coolant</strong>, or “antifreeze.” You can usually buy it at gas stations when you “check the fluids.” It is typically green or pink. <strong>You must never use just water; this will damage the engine in a very short time period.</strong></p><p>You can see how this system works in the following image: the liquid takes the heat generated by the engine and takes it to the <strong>radiator</strong>. There is a <strong>pump </strong>that makes the liquid flow, and it pushes it along the circuit. The hot liquid enters through the upper part of the radiator, and it comes out being cool from the bottom part.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/bbb1b168_Sin título1.png\"></div><p></p><p>In order to keep its good performance, the engine of your 500 must always stay within the optimal temperature range, which is usually around 190ºF (90°C). To guarantee this temperature, the system has two “auxiliary” pieces that control temperatures: the thermostat and the electric fan. The <strong>thermostat </strong>prevents the coolant from cooling too much, and the <strong>electric fan</strong> stops it from heating.</p><p>The<strong> temperature sensor</strong> monitors the whole system that is usually controlled by the central computer or by a separate electronic module, depending on the car manufacturer.</p><p>Like in every system, any of these parts may malfunction or get damaged, and that will make the engine overheat, as we explained above.</p>",

Moreover, if the car has a diesel engine, this system will also block the “stop” relay, which will prevent the fuel from being injected into the engine. Sometimes, this system will also block the steering column which will lock the steering wheel.</p><h2>Why is the immobilizer activated on a 500?</h2><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">The main reason is because the car's computer does not recognize or does not detect the signal sent by the chip which is inside the key.

                        "<h2>What engine oil does your 500 need?</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In a few words:</strong><br>The best type of engine oil that you can use is the <strong>synthetic</strong> one. You will find the rest of specifications such as <strong>viscosity and quality</strong> in the <a href=\"/abarth/500/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> of your 500.</p><h2>What is oil viscosity and which is better for your 500?</h2><p>Viscosity is a <strong>measure of an oil’s resistance to flow</strong>: The thicker (higher viscosity) the oil, the slower it will flow and it will take more time to reach every part of the engine. It is commonly said that the oil is \"heavier\" when it is more viscous and \"lighter\" in the opposite case. Viscosity grades are measured based on SAE standards. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p>We advise you to look for the recommended viscosity in your <a href=\"/abarth/500/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> or ask your trusted mechanic. If you can’t find the information and you have to change the engine oil, this is what you have to know: </p><p>When engines work at low temperatures (engine start), the oil should be more fluid in order to reach every part of the engine and ensure immediate lubrication. After a few minutes, the temperature of the engine will rise and, ideally, the oil viscosity should be higher. This ensures proper lubrication without breaking the lubricant film. Nowadays, all oils meet this requirement and they are called <strong>multigrade oils </strong>(lower viscosity at cold temperatures and higher viscosity at hot temperatures).</p><p><strong>A medium viscosity level would be the SAE 10W-40 engine oil</strong>, which meet the needs of the current car models without difficulty.</p><p>If you live in a place where the temperature drops to 14° F (-10° C) or less you should use an oil with lower viscosity (5W-40 for example).<strong></strong></p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\"> ⚠️ If your vehicle has over 124,000 mi and consumes oil or you see some white smoke coming from the exhaust pipe, you can use an oil with a slightly higher viscosity to compensate for wear. </p><h2>Which engine oil should your 500 use?</h2><p><strong></strong>You can find the specific engine oil quality for your 500 in <strong>the Maintenance section </strong>of your <a href=\"/abarth/500/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>. If you can’t find it there, keep in mind the following: </p><p>Lubricants are classified by the American Petroleum Institute (API) based on their performance level.

                        "<h2>What styles of car bodies exist?</h2><p>The body of a car is <strong>the space where the passengers and the cargo are placed.</strong> In promotional pamphlets, you usually read words like Sedan, Minivan, SUV, Hatchback, etc. All of them are related to the <strong>car body style</strong>. In this article, we will tell you how to classify different car bodies and their particular features.</p><h2>Types according to body configuration</h2><p>According to their configuration, car bodies can be distinguished from each other because of their <strong>designs, that is to say, their geometrical structure is well-defined</strong>. In these images, you can see their shapes highlighted in color. The type will change according to the number of boxes their design has:</p><ul><li><strong>One-box design, monospace or monovolume: </strong>the car body does not have any divisions; it has a one-box design. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/55a7faf1_Monovolumen.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Two-box design: </strong>they have two volumes.

In this list, the number of doors and the way the trunk is opened, among other characteristics, will be included. In this group, the different car styles will be <strong>grouped esthetically</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Sedan: </strong>it has a three-box design with four doors. It is the most common car, and you can see it has a front section (hood), a middle section (cabin), and a rear section (trunk). <strong>It has a horizontal trunk lid that does not include the glass of the rear window.</strong><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/c46c58ee_SEDAN FINAL.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Berlina: </strong>it is very similar to sedan cars, but <strong>the trunk lid does include the glass of the rear window</strong>. This means that you can enter the cabin through the trunk. That is why this design is said to have five doors. Esthetically speaking, if we compare them to sedan cars, the trunk seems smaller in comparison to the cabin.  <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/6e2e8048_berlina.png\"></div></li><li><strong>Station wagon: </strong>they have a two-box design where the <strong>cabin </strong>and the <strong>trunk share a volume</strong>.

The idle speed, also known simply as “idle,” is the amount of revolutions that the engine keeps when our foot is not pressing the accelerator. The IAC valve is controlled by the computer and it balances any burden upon the engine, like the usage of the air conditioner, the lights or the sound system. When the engine is cold, it helps it start by keeping the revolutions somewhat higher until the engine heats up.</p><h2>Symptoms that show that your 500‘s IAC valve is failing</h2><ul><li>The engine stalls when the car is idling (idle speed)</li><li>It is hard to start the vehicle when the engine is cold</li><li>Unstable revolutions that go up and down</li><li>The engine stalls if the air conditioner is turned on</li><li>The “check engine” light comes on</li></ul><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️ You should check the IAC valve periodically to make sure it is clean, since it usually malfunctions because of the accumulation of carbon residue which is produced by the combustion of the engine.</p>",

You should choose the right one both for your children and your car. If you want to know which one to use, you should read the <a href=\"/abarth/500/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> of your 500. Take into account that different brands may have different ways to anchor the seats, but they should always be <strong>certified according to the regulations</strong> we will now mention.</p><h2>Booster seat sizes</h2><p>Booster seats can be categorized according to the 3 main safety regulations: the <strong>FMVSS 213</strong> (American) and european <strong>ECE R44</strong> and <strong>UN R129</strong> (a.k.a. <strong>i-Size</strong>, newer and more complete).

                        "<h2> Exhaust smoke and its colors on a 500: causes and severity</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In a few words:</strong><br>According to the color of the exhaust smoke that is released from the exhaust pipe of your 500 you will be able to identify the possible causes. The colors of the exhaust smoke that your 500 may produce will help you find the problem. In <strong>order of priority </strong>from the least to the most dangerous, these colors are:<strong> white, blue, black, mix of two colors</strong>.</p><p>First, it should be said that the exhaust gas that is usually released through the exhaust pipe of your car is basically <strong>invisible</strong>. You should see a faint and short-lived exhaust that fades shortly after appearing only if you speed up abruptly. If your 500 discharges visible exhaust smoke then it is very likely that you need to take it to a specialist.</p><h2>White exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a 500</h2><p>The exhaust gas that comes out without strength and elevates considerably (it may get over the roof) but then fades without any trace when your car is idling may only be <strong>water vapor.</strong> This exhaust does not smell like anything in particular and it can be seen if the temperature is low or if there is humidity. <strong>If this is the case, do not worry.</strong></p><p><strong>If the white exhaust smoke does not fade, it is dense and smells, then</strong> it is associated with a <strong>coolant leak</strong>. In this case, the <strong>coolant level</strong> of your 500 <strong>should be low</strong>. Have your car checked up by a specialist to confirm this leak and prevent your engine from overheating.</p><p>⚠️<strong> Check the recovery tank. </strong>If you see that the <strong>coolant is bubbling</strong> that means that it is leaking into the combustion chamber. This is caused by a leak of exhaust gases into the cooling system. If your car has these symptoms <strong>you should</strong> <strong>have your engine checked</strong> by a specialist at once since this malfunction may bring serious problems.</p><p>This liquid leak may be caused by the following reasons:</p><ul><li>The cylinder head gasket is damaged (which is the cheapest problem to fix)</li><li>The cylinder head or the engine block are cracked (which is more expensive)</li></ul><h2>Blue exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a 500</h2><p>At first sight this exhaust smoke seems white but it has a <strong>blueish tone, a certain density and a particular smell, like something is burning. </strong>Moreover, its <strong>volume increases significantly when you step on the accelerator.</strong></p><p>This blue exhaust smoke indicates that the <strong>lubricant oil is burning</strong>, either because there is a leak into the inside of the combustion chamber or a leak into the exhaust system.</p><p>⚠️ <strong>Check if the level of lubricant oil</strong> of your 500 <strong>is decreasing drastically</strong> to verify if that is the cause.</p><p>The causes for this lubricant leak are usually the following:</p><ul><li><strong>The valve stem seals are in a bad shape</strong></li><li>The <strong>piston rings are worn down</strong></li><li>Leaks of oil in the supercharger (if the engine of you 500 has this system)</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, fixing any of these problems is expensive and they usually affect<strong> high mileage engines</strong> (with more than 90,000 miles) or cars with <strong>badly battered engines</strong>.</p><p><strong>If the exhaust smoke is blue but it is not too dense</strong>, it may be caused by a blockage in the crankcase ventilation system.</p><p>⚠️ In this case, <strong>the exhaust smoke will come from the engine and not from the exhaust pipe</strong>.</p><p>It is normal to see blueish exhaust coming from the exhaust pipe of mopeds and motorbikes with a two-stroke engine, and, in those cases, this exhaust is not caused by a failure.</p><h2>Black exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a 500</h2><p>This problem <strong>is usually seen in diesel engines</strong> and it is caused by a <strong>great increase in the amount of fuel supplied to the engine</strong>, that is to say, the engine is burning more fuel than it should.</p><p>⚠️ Check if the <strong>consumption of fuel</strong> of your 500 <strong>has increased significantly</strong>.<strong> You should also notice</strong> this because of <strong>the reduction of power </strong>of the engine.</p><p>You can also verify this flaw by <strong>putting a white cloth inside the exhaust pipe, clogging it up for a few seconds</strong>. This cloth will <strong>turn black</strong> instantly due to the expelled coal particles.</p><p>This black color is caused by the generation of hydrocarbons that are not completely burnt. They create more <strong>carbonaceous particles</strong> which soil the lubricant oil and they settle in each nook and cranny of the engine of your 500. At the same time, they are also accumulated inside the combustion chamber as hard crusts that are abrasive and wear down movable pieces.</p><p>The exhaust system is also affected because of the accumulation of cinder, which also poses a threat to the catalytic converter, the particle filter or the muffler of the car.</p><p>This problem may be caused by any of the following items:</p><ul><li>The air filter is too dirty.</li><li>The fuel injectors, the fuel pressure regulator, the throttle position sensor (TPS), or the Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor are dirty or there is an electrical flaw in them.</li><li>The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve is malfunctioning (this valve recirculates the exhaust gases back to the engine). When you accelerate, this EGR valve remains open so that the exhaust gases can get inside the engine once again.</li></ul><h2>Two-colored exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a 500</h2><p>In the worst case scenario the released exhaust will be two-colored. This means that there are many simultaneous causes for this problem and it is important that a specialist investigates this as soon as possible to prevent further failures.</p>",
                        "<h2>What do the technical specifications of your 500’s engine mean?</h2><p>Even though all engines are very similar when you look at them, there are many different types. We will now show you what the most usual technical specifications that you can find in the <strong>technical datasheet</strong> of your <strong> 500 </strong>mean.</p><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Gasoline or Diesel engines</strong><br><br>This is the main difference between engines. Engines that need Diesel have incandescent spark plugs that only work when the car starts. Once the engine is running, the fuel ignites by itself since it is compressed inside the cylinders thanks to the high temperature it reaches.<br>On the other hand, gasoline engines work thanks to the spark constantly created by the spark plugs. This means that they work all the time the engine is running.<br>Another difference between these two engines is that Diesel engines are generally heavier, and their structure is more robust.</li><li><strong>Number of cylinders</strong><br><br>It is the <strong>number</strong> of cylinders inside the engine. <strong>The engine power is generated </strong>in the cylinders because that is where the pistons are. For this reason, the more cylinders the engine has, the more its power will be. This also means that the engine will be bigger and heavier. It is also important to notice that if there are a lot of cylinders, the engine will consume more fuel. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/bloque.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Bore/stroke ratio</strong><br><br><strong>These are the piston’s measurements, </strong>and they can be expressed in centimeters or inches. They indicate the cylinder diameter (bore) and the longitudinal displacement (stroke) that the piston does inside the cylinder when the engine is running. These measurements allow us to measure the “displaced volume” by the piston. <strong>If the diameter is wide and the piston has a short stroke, the engine will be fit for sports cars.</strong> In other words, the revolutions per minute (RPMs) will be high.  <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/cf9931c1_carrera y diametro.png\"></div></li><li><strong>Engine displacement</strong><br><br>It is the total available volume in the engine cylinders. It is calculated by multiplying the stroke length, the bore, and the number of cylinders.<br>Depending on the country, it may be expressed in liters (1.6 L, 2.0 L, 3.6 L), or in cubic inches (98, 110, 250, 510 CI).<br>Generally, <strong>the higher the engine displacement is, the more power your car will have, but the higher its fuel consumption will be.</strong></li><li><strong>Cylinder arrangement</strong><br><br>a) In-line arrangement: nowadays, it is hard to find engines with more than 6 in-line cylinders because they take up too much space under the hood.<br><br>b) V-type arrangement: They are more compact and create fewer vibrations, but they can only be used with an even number of cylinders (V6, V8, V10, etc.).<br><br>c) Opposed arrangement: they are flat and not frequently used because their manufacture and maintenance are very demanding. Moreover, like the V-type arrangement, they can only be used with an even number of cylinders. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/tipo_de_motor.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Valvetrain type: SOHC and DOHC</strong><br><br>a) SOHC (single overhead camshaft):  It only has one camshaft placed in the cylinder head. Only one camshaft controls all the engine’s valves. They generally have more power if there are low RPMs. The camshaft is in charge of opening and closing the engine’s valves.<br>b) DOHC (double overhead camshaft): It has two camshafts placed in the cylinder head. One camshaft controls the admission valve while the other controls the escape valve. The performance of these engines is usually better if the RPMs are high. Moreover, its parts are usually lighter and can move faster.</li><li><strong>Compression ratio</strong><br><br><strong>It is the measurement of how much the volume of the air-fuel mixture can be compressed inside of the cylinder.</strong> The higher this number is, the higher the engine power will be. For example, if there is an 8:1 ratio, this means that the mixture will be reduced to one octave of its original volume.<br>Generally, compression ratios are between 8:1 and 12:1 for gasoline engines.</li><li><strong>Naturally aspirated or turbo engines</strong><br><br>A <strong>naturally aspired</strong> engine means <strong>that the engine draws air directly through an air intake.</strong> In turbocharged cars, on the other hand,<strong> the turbocharger injects air by forcing it into the engine.</strong> The advantage of using turbochargers is that, in small engines, the power increases because it is possible to inject more air and fuel into the cylinders.</li><li><strong> Torque</strong><br><br><strong>It is the “strength” that the engine has when it accelerates.</strong><br>It is measured in “foot-pounds” or in “N.m” (1 N.m = 0.737 ft.lb), and to express it, the RPM of the engine must also be stated. For example: 150 N.m @ 1700 RPM.<br>Off-road cars usually have a lot of torque and not so much power. This enables them to drive up big slopes at a slow speed or dodge big pits and rocks. Diesel engines have more torque than gasoline engines.</li><li><strong> Power</strong><br><br><strong>It is the car’s ability to accelerate (to react) at high speeds.</strong><br>It is measured in HP (Horse Power), or in KW (1 HP = 0.745 KW).</li><li><strong> Revolutions per minute (RPM)</strong><br><br><strong>They represent the engine speed. It is important to distinguish them from the car speed since they are not the same thing.</strong> Both are related by the transmission. For example, if the car is in neutral gear and we press the accelerator, we may only change the engine speed but not the car speed.<br>Technically speaking: <em>Torque x RPM = Power</em><br>In a car, the RPM are controlled by the accelerator. Their rise depends on how much we press the accelerator, and this will be reflected in the tachometer. The higher the RPMs are, the noisier the engine will be.</li></ol>",

They are cheap, disposable and there are <strong>different types</strong> according to their usage and the amount of <strong>amperage</strong> they transmit.<br>There are Bosch fuses (or torpedo or GCB), cylinder fuses (or cartridge) made of glass, blade (or spade) fuses, cartridge fuses (JSCASE and MCASE), and high current fuses. The same car may have up to 3 types of fuses for its different circuits.</p><p>Fuses are pieces that <strong>protect the electrical circuits</strong>. That is to say, every time an electrical component of your 500 <strong>suddenly stops working</strong>, there might be a <strong>blown fuse</strong>. The good news is that fuses are really <strong>cheap and easy to replace</strong>. For this reason, before you mourn the loss of your stereo, air conditioner, or other devices, you should first check these little pieces.</p><p>All of them work in the same way and, the other good news is that they have no front or backside, so they are <strong>easy to put into place</strong>. Despite their small size, they have a <strong>calibrated conductor for the highest current they can withstand</strong>, and if the current goes over this value, the conductor breaks, which interrupts the circuit and makes it impossible for the current to keep on flowing. The visible result is that the system stops working, but it is just because there is no current, not because of a serious problem.</p><p>Each type of fuse has a <strong>normalized value </strong>that can be easily recognizable because it is <strong>engraved in its body</strong>.</p><p>You can see where the fuse box of your 500 is located and what each fuse protects in the <a href=\"/abarth/500/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.</p><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️Every time you change a fuse, you should do it while your 500 is turned off.</p><h2>Fuse types</h2><p>There are many fuse types, but these are the most common in the automotive industry:</p><p><strong>Blade (or spade) fuses:</strong></p><p>They are used in vehicles manufactured since the year 2000 up to now.</p><p>They have a rectangular shape, a flat contour, and a plastic, transparent body.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/e69d5b39_500px-Electrical_fuses,_blade_type.svg.png\"></div><p></p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\"><strong>There are many different sizes:</strong><br><br>Micro2 (APT - ATR)  -  with 5 to 30 amperes.<br>Micro3 (ATL)  -  with 5 to 15 amperes.<br>Low profile Mini (APS), wrongly known as \"micro\" - with 2 to 30 amperes.<br>Mini (ATM - APM) - their ends are smaller than those of Micro2 fuses -  with 2 to 30 amperes.<br>High/Regular/Standard - with 0.5 to 40 amperes.<br>Maxi (APX) - with 20 to 120 amperes.</p><p><strong>Cartridge fuses (JCASE and MCASE):</strong></p><p>They usually have a female connector, but there are also male ones.

                        "<h2>How to keep your 500 safe during extended periods without use</h2><p>If your 500 has to stay in one place for a long time, here are some recommendations to keep your car in the best possible condition.</p><p><strong>Battery:</strong> Disconnect the negative terminal of the battery. This will prevent the electrical components from consuming it, and it will prevent any future problems when you start your 500.</p><p><strong>Tires: </strong>Inflate your car’s tires with more pressure than the recommended one for driving. Either 3 or 4 psi should be enough. Like this, they will not get deformed when they naturally deflate.</p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">If you will not use your 500 for a few months, you can also create some sort of support with bricks (or any other elements) and place it under the chassis so that it can help the wheels hold the weight of the car when the wheels deflate.</p><p><strong>Fuel:</strong> Ideally, the fuel tank should be full. If there is less air inside of the tank, there is less probability of it evaporating. Additionally, like this, if the tank is metallic, you will prevent its rusting.</p><p><strong>Hand brake:</strong> You must never activate it unless it is really necessary. It has a wire in its mechanism, and if this wire stays taut for a long period, it may get damaged. Also the brake pad (brake shoe) may get stuck or corrode the pieces it is in contact with.</p><p><strong>Fluids and oils:</strong> Check that the levels of refrigerant, steering fluid, brake fluid, and oil of your 500 are the recommended ones.</p><p><strong>Start:</strong> If you can, start your 500 once every ten days. This will prevent the wear of the mechanical pieces of the engine, and it will recharge the battery. During those moments, you should also turn the air conditioner on, move the automatic windows and turn all the lights on and off. The movement of the circuits will keep your car in good shape.</p><p><strong>Exhaust pipe: </strong>Put a small cloth with motor oil in the external part of the exhaust pipe to prevent corrosion.</p><p><strong>Cleaning: </strong>Prevent bad smells and mold in the car by cleaning the inside of the car thoroughly. You may also leave some carbon or a cup with dry rice inside so that they will absorb humidity.</p><p>To keep the outside of the car clean, you can wax your car and then cover it with a car tarpaulin.</p><p></p>",
                        "<h2>What light bulbs fit your 500?</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In short:</strong><br>If one of your 500‘s bulbs burned out and you want to know which one you should buy to replace it, you can remove it and take it to an auto part store, or you can check the maintenance section found in the <a href=\"/abarth/500/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.<br>If you replaced the bulb but it is still not working, you should check the fuses.</p><p>Your 500 has bulbs that illuminate both the outside and the inside of the car. Since headlamps are more complex, there are many types. They are the ones that illuminate the road ahead without dazzling the other drivers. Brake lights are only there to be seen at a sensible distance by the drivers behind you, and their purpose is to light up when you press the brake pedal.</p><p><strong>Generally, changing these bulbs is easy,</strong> and you can do it yourself. Cars have a different lighting system from that of a house since they are guaranteed to keep working despite the vehicle’s vibrations. You only have to make sure that their <strong>pigtail wire has been properly connected</strong>. You will know they have been connected properly because <strong>there is only one way they can be connected</strong>.</p><p>You should <strong>have a spare bulb in your 500</strong> if you are about to go on a road trip. Even if <strong>a bulb has a lifespan of several years</strong>, they are cheap and it never hurts to be careful.</p><ul><li><strong>LED lamps</strong></li></ul><p>The main advantage of LED lamps is their <strong>efficiency</strong>: they produce <strong>a lot of light,</strong> and they <strong>draw less electrical energy (</strong>up to 80% less<strong>)</strong>. Moreover, their <strong>lifespan is 25 times longer</strong> than the lifespan of a halogen lamp. LED lamps are <strong>instantly on</strong> and, since the component that produces light is relatively small, these lamps can be created in any shape or form. They are made of semiconductor materials enclosed in a small, plastic shell and only one lamp may produce different colors.</p><p>There are a lot of high-end brands that use LED technology for their products, but their usage of fixed LED light panels makes it almost impossible for them to be changed without having to visit an authorized car dealer.</p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/0af84ef3_Untitled4-628x280.png\"></div><p></p><ul><li><strong>Incandescent lamps</strong></li></ul><p>They are the <strong>oldest ones, they consume a lot of energy and create a lot of heat.</strong> They are made up of a metallic filament which is protected by a transparent glass bulb. When the electricity goes through the filament, it turns bright red and it produces light. Nowadays, these lamps are still used to illuminate <strong>car interiors, dashboard lights, brake lights, direction-indicator lights, and front position lights</strong>, since these lights do not need to be too powerful. They have different watts, sizes, and shapes according to their usage. They may have 1 or 2 filaments (just like the brake lights).</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/e7ba5170_Incandenscentes.jpg\"></div><p></p><ul><li><strong>Halogen lamps</strong></li></ul><p><strong>They are the enhanced version of incandescent lamps.</strong> <strong>The light they produce is stronger and whiter.</strong> They work the same way; the only difference is that the glass bulb encloses halogen gas, which improves the filament’s output and, therefore, also enhances its lifespan. For these reasons, these lamps are more efficient, and small halogen lamps may be powerful.</p><p>These lamps may have <strong>different</strong> amounts of filaments, their filaments may be placed in different positions, and the shape of their bulbs may be different.

They are the most compact ones. They only include a small wire to connect them. There are 55, 70 and 100-W H3 lamps.</p><p><strong>H4 lamps</strong>: They are the most used in <strong>headlamps because they can also be used as dipped beam headlights and high beam lights, which saves space.</strong> They have two filaments, and they are bigger than the other types of lamps. There are usually 55/60, 70/75, and 90/100-W H4 lamps (for crossings/highways).</p><p><strong>H7 lamps</strong>: They are mainly used in <strong>fog lamps</strong>. They only have one linear filament, and they are somewhat bigger than H1 and H3 lamps.</p><ul><li><strong>Xenon lamps</strong></li></ul><p><strong>They are the brightest ones,</strong> and the light they produce is whiter than the one made by halogen lamps. Their downside is that the electrical energy needed to turn these lamps on must be high (30,000 V). Their arc needs a high current, so they need auxiliary equipment called reactance, which is in charge of controlling the electrical energy of the lamp. If you are thinking of switching to Xenon’s lamps, an auto mechanic should do it for you.</p><p><strong>These lights take one minute to reach their maximum power.</strong> The good thing is that once you turn these lights on, they <strong>consume less electricity than halogen lamps</strong>, <strong>generate less heat and their lifespan is way longer.</strong> They are <strong>more expensive</strong> than the other lamps.</p><p>Regarding their structure, they do not have filaments. They have two electrodes, separated by a few millimeters protected by a glass bulb where there is high-pressure Xenon gas. An electrical arc that produces light is created between these two electrodes. You can see this light in the following image.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/5f306ae3_xenon-lampara3.jpg\"></div><p></p>",

Sometimes, they are really tight. Do not let any <strong>dirt enter the cylinder holes</strong> from where you removed the spark plugs. If anything falls inside the cylinders, you will have to take it out no matter what, which will be a nuisance.</li><li>Put the new spark plugs in and turn the wrench clockwise. <strong>Tighten</strong> the spark plugs until they are all the way down, but <strong>do not over-tighten them</strong>.</li><li>Once they are down, <strong>you must use the wrench to secure them</strong> like this: tighten spark plugs with a flat seat (with a washer), an extra ½ of a turn, and spark plugs with a tapered seat an extra ⅛ of a turn. They must be tight but not <strong>overly tight.</strong> If they are over-tightened, the thread may break.  <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/e2319e13_image.png\"></div></li><li>Reconnect the wires in the same order they were connected.</li></ol><p>And that is it.

If your car is very loaded, you could go up to 38 psi without  problems. For sport cars (with very low profile tires), the usual thing to do  is to  inflate them to<strong> ​40 psi​. </strong><br><strong>2- ​Look up the recommendation in your  <a href=\"/abarth/500/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a></strong>.  <br><strong>3- Look up the tag in your car. </strong>​You can find it sticked in the internal frame of the  driver’s door, in the fuel-charger lid or in the sun shield.

Here we show you an example where you will be able to see how to  interpret its data: </p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/etiqueta_neumaticos_2.PNG\"></div> <p></p><p>A - The columns on the right show the pressure of the back tires.  </p><p>B - The columns on the left show the pressure of the front tires. </p><p>C - If we read the  rows horizontally we will see that there is a recommended  pressure according to the load that our car will carry (represented in people and  luggage).  </p><p>D - The information that appears at the bottom is the recommended pressure for  your temporary auxiliary tire, which is not the same as the one recommended for the  rest of the tires, due to its smaller size. </p><p>E - The data ​T125/60​ and  R18 which appears in this example corresponds to the  measurements of the temporary auxiliary tire.  </p><p>Depending on the country of origin of your 500, the pressure of the tires  may be measured in  \"psi\" (commonly called “pounds”) in  \"bar\" or in “Kpa”.  That’s why in your car’s chart you can find any of them. Take  the machine that you will use for the measurements and <strong>check which unit it uses  and ​consider only that data in the tag​.</strong> The other data  will be the equivalent in other  units, so you don’t need to use it.</p><h2>When shall I check the pressure of the tires of my 500? </h2><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">⚠   <strong>We recommend you to check the pressure of the tires once every 15 days​</strong> and every time you are  about to start a long trip. You must do this measurement<strong> with ​cold tires for it to be precise. </strong>​Meaning,  don’t do it in the middle of a long journey because you will probably get a useless reading. Keep in mind that, while running, the tires get naturally deformed, by producing heat and absorbing the heat  from the road. The temperature rise makes ​the pressure to rise​ as well and then we might get higher values than we should in the measurement. </p><h2>Why is it important to respect the recommended pressure in your 500? </h2><p>The tires’ pressure was well studied by the manufacturers in order to guarantee: </p><ul><li> <strong>Security​: </strong>it improves the maneuverability and the stability and reduces the  braking. Also, it reduces the temperature of the tires, lessening the  chances of having punctures. </li><li> <strong>Fuel efficiency​: </strong>tires with the appropriate pressure generate less  resistance for the wheels and will therefore spend less fuel, contributing  both to saving money and with the environment.</li><li><strong> Reduces tire erosion: </strong>​the tires will be deformed less and will be less  mechanically demanded. In consequence, they will have longer life time. On top of this, the tire’s erosion will be even in the whole tire.<strong>Comfort​</strong>: you will feel that your car is more stable and will feel less the  potential irregularities of the road (because you will have better shock  absorbency). </li></ul><h2>Erosion according with the tire inflation level on a 500 </h2><p>The correct tire inflation level ensures that the tires’ footprint is optimal. More or  less pressure will provoque undesired deformations. As a consequence, <strong>there will be  an​ uneven erosion ​and ​less adherence ​than the one needed​</strong>.</p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/neumatico-desgaste.jpg\"></div><p></p><h2>Can I use a different pressure on my 500? </h2><p>You can use other pressure, but only in specific situations and knowing its possible  consequences: </p><ul><li> <strong>When you ride in sand​:</strong> lowering the pressure to 15 pounds will make  the tire’s track to widen and the tire to be in more contact with the field,  improving traction. Going back to a harder surface, you will need to  pump up the tires again for not damaging them.</li><li> <strong>To reduce fuel’s consumption:</strong> ​one can rise in 3 or 4 pounds the  pressure while circulating in a city. The other side of the coin of this tip is  that you will feel the irregularities of the road much more, you will have a worse ground attachment and you will have more erosion of the tire in its central area.  </li></ul><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠  An important recommendation: while  circulating in wet grounds​ (such as the ones you find on a rainy day), it is key to keep the adequate pressure, recommended by the manufacturer; because it will  guarantee you better adherence to the ground and therefore you will avoid accidents.  </p>",

The two of them are derived from petroleum, and they are formed by hydrocarbons (hydrogen and carbon molecules).</p><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️  <strong>The main rule is that you must only use diesel in Diesel engines and gasoline in spark-ignition engines </strong>(called “Otto cycle engines”).<strong> Otherwise, the engine of your 500 may get ruined.</strong></p><p>To obtain energy from fuel, it must be burning: in a Diesel engine, the diesel burns because of the compression, and in an Otto cycle engine, it burns by a spark created by the spark plug. For this reason, each type of fuel has different characteristics: diesel is more oily and takes longer to burn, while gasoline is more volatile and burns a lot faster.</p><p>Diesel engines are more efficient than Otto engines, but their exhaust smoke is more contaminant. For this reason, they have to go through certain processes to comply with the pollution prevention laws, and that makes them more expensive.</p><p><strong>Natural gas </strong>is the third type of fuel, and it is mainly used in Latin-American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. To use it, many modifications should be made to the fuel system of the car, and a certified company should do it. This type of fuel makes the car have less autonomy than the other ones, so the engine’s performance may not be ideal, but since it is <strong>a lot cheaper</strong>, it is also popular.</p><p>There are two other types of fuel that are massively used: <strong>biodiesel </strong>and <strong>ethanol</strong> (ethylic alcohol). They are generally used as additives, the first one for Diesel fuel and the second one for gasoline.

If you decrease their usage you will see improved fuel economy. Another way of optimizing fuel consumption is by using the recommended type of fuel for your 500.</p><p><strong> </strong>To know the recommended fuel for your 500 you can check the <a href=\"/abarth/500/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>. <strong></strong></p><p><strong>It is important to use the recommended fuel so that the fuel consumption of your 500 is optimal.</strong></p><h2>Common factors that affect the normal fuel consumption on a 500:</h2><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Driving manner: drive in a stable manner.</strong> Aggressive acceleration and braking will drastically increase fuel consumption since they require more engine power.</li><li><strong>If the car has a manual transmission, do not step on the clutch pedal as soon as you step on the brakes:</strong> cars with electronic fuel injection usually cut fuel supply when you stop stepping on the accelerator when the car is put in gear. Take advantage of the “engine braking” by letting the car stop on its own. In this way fuel consumption will decrease A LOT.</li><li><strong>Speed</strong>: the higher the speed, the greater the power needed. <strong>On highways, the optimal speed is of 60 mph with the car set in its highest gear.</strong> If we take into account the laws of physics, doubling the speed means increasing the power 8 times.</li><li><strong>Air conditioner</strong>: Always use the air conditioner in <strong>“recirculation” mode</strong>. Air conditioning consumes quite a lot of the engine's energy. Cooling the air inside the cabin is a lot easier than cooling the air coming from outside constantly. On the other hand, as the air conditioner compressor is usually mechanically connected to the engine, if there are more engine revolutions the energy consumption will increase.</li><li><strong>Tire pressure</strong>: it is important that your tires have the<strong> pressure indicated</strong> by the manufacturer, both to have minimal fuel consumption as well as for security, to preserve the tires in optimal conditions with minimal wear. To know the recommended pressure for your tires you can read our <a class=\"\" href=\"/abarth/500/guides/tire-pressure\">\n                <span class=\"\">tire pressure guide.</span>\n              </a></li><li><strong>Rolled down car windows</strong>: if the windows are rolled down the aerodynamics of the car will be reduced and aerodynamics play an important role when going at <strong>more than 45 mph</strong>, when air resistance increases considerably.</li><li> <strong>Electrical consumption</strong>: it may be caused because <strong>more lights </strong>were added or because the <strong>sound</strong> system was upgraded to a more powerful one. This consumes more of the battery's electricity, which at the same time will need more of the alternator's supply, which will eventually consume more of the engine's power.</li></ol><h2>Issues of your 500 which increase fuel consumption</h2><ul><li><strong>Tight brakes</strong>: If you feel that your car subtly brakes all the time, you should take it to a mechanic so that they can <strong>clean and adjust the brakes</strong>. If you don't do this, you will accelerate more than you want just to maintain a specific speed.</li><li><strong>Defective battery</strong>: a defective battery lowers its efficiency and makes it require more electrical power from the alternator (which, in turn, consumes more of the engine's power).</li><li><strong>Clogged up air filter</strong>: this decreases combustion efficiency and more fuel is required to achieve the same power.</li><li><strong>Damaged spark plugs and/or spark plugs' wires</strong>: the spark of the spark plugs is weaker than usual and the fuel burns in an incomplete manner, for which reason more fuel is needed to achieve the same power (or speed).</li><li><strong>Defective ignition coil</strong>: this is just like the previous item, but you should notice this problem when you drive, as the engine works in a “mismatched” manner; you can feel vibrations, your car suddenly stops or it jerks when you accelerate or drive at a constant speed.</li><li><strong>Leaks in the fuel circuit</strong>: You can identify them if you perceive a constant gasoline <strong>smell</strong>.</li><li><strong>Dirty or damaged injectors</strong>: they may lead to the leak of small quantities of fuel when it is not necessary, even with the engine stopped. This may also damage the exhaust system of the engine as the waste is accumulated.</li><li><strong>Dirty or damaged fuel filter</strong>: it allows the filth to go through, which damages the injectors.</li><li><strong>Faulty oxygen sensor (Lambda probe)</strong>: it indicates incorrect oxygen values which makes the air and the fuel mix inadequately and this increases fuel consumption.</li><li> <strong>Faulty mass air flow sensor</strong>: this electronic management system has no way of knowing clearly how much air is actually going inside the engine, and for this reason this mixture becomes inefficient, as well as the combustion.</li></ul><p>You can check fuel consumption by paying attention to the <strong><em>instantaneous consumption</em></strong> and the <strong><em>average consumption</em></strong>, which can be verified in cars with an on-board computer. The first one will give you a reference to evaluate in which cases your car consumes the lowest amount of fuel so as to repeat these scenarios, and the second one will give you a value to compare with the values of other users to check if your car’s fuel consumption is average or if your car has <strong>any of the problems mentioned</strong> in the previous section.</p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\"> <strong>✔️</strong> <strong>Recommendations if you want to buy a car with good fuel economy:</strong><br><br><strong>1 - </strong>Choose small cars with small engines.<br><strong>2 - </strong>It is important that these cars do not have a “square” shape, their body should be more aerodynamic.<br><strong>3 - </strong>Look up information about fuel consumption declared by their manufacturers and other users so that you can compare them.</p>",

However, they will not improve your engine’s condition, so you will only be spending more money unnecessarily. On the other hand, <strong>if you use fuel with lower octanes than the required amount, your engine’s performance will worsen</strong>, and you may notice that there is smoke coming out of the tailpipe since it is consuming more fuel than usual. <strong>If the amount of octanes of the fuel you use is too low, there will be mechanical troubles </strong>(like rattling sounds), and the engine may get damaged.</p><p>In the rest of the world, <strong>the octane rating is usually stated in the RON measure</strong>. There is another measure called <strong>MON</strong>, but it is not as frequently used. RON and MON are the names of the processes by which the gasoline octanes are measured in laboratories.</p><p>Generally, regular cars require 95 RON, while modern or premium cars require 98 RON.</p><p>If you want to know which fuel you should use in your 500, you can read the following article <a class=\"\" href=\"/abarth/500/guides/recommended-type-of-fuel\">\n                <span class=\"\">Which type of fuel should you use in your 500?</span>\n              </a></p><p> </p><p>You should also read this guide<a class=\"\" href=\"/abarth/500/guides/fuel-consumption\">\n                <span class=\"\">How to improve the fuel consumption of your 500</span>\n              </a></p><p></p>",

How to use a multimeter to check the status of your 500‘s battery</strong></p><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Get the car ready: </strong>To check the voltage of the battery, the engine of your 500must always be turned off. If the engine is on, you should turn it off and let it rest for at least 5 minutes so that its electric charge stabilizes. In both cases, you should turn the headlamps on for 30 seconds and then turn them off. This will get rid of small voltages which may produce wrong readings.</li><li><strong>Get the multimeter ready: </strong>To adjust the multimeter you must turn the selector up to the option that reads 20 V. In that way, it will be placed in the measurement scope you need.</li><li><strong>Measure your 500‘s battery while the engine is off: </strong>After you turn the multimeter on, connect the red probe to the positive terminal (+) of the battery, which is usually marked in red color too, and then connect the <strong>black probe</strong> to the negative terminal (-). If these terminals are dirty, you should scratch them softly with the tip of the multimeter until metal and metal can touch. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/comprobar-el-estado-de-la-batería-de-un-coche-medir-voltaje.jpg\"></div><br>The multimeter will display the “available voltage” of the battery.

If you read your manual, you will be able to see which <em>capacity and power</em> your 500needs to start. If there is an emergency, you should buy the same battery your car already had. Afterward, when you have time, you can check which battery is required according to your car’s manufacturer. <strong></strong></p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">⚠️ You should <strong>always buy batteries that were manufactured no more than 6 months ago</strong>, because they work with chemical processes, and there will always be internal wear with time which will decrease its lifespan. <strong>You can check the fabrication date on the battery tag.</strong></p><p><strong>Recommendation for liquid batteries: </strong>Nowadays, most of the batteries are sealed and do not require any maintenance, but if the battery of your 500<strong>includes filler caps, you should check its liquid level</strong> and, if it is low, add liquid up until the indicated level. In this case, you should<strong> let the battery rest </strong>for 10 minutes and then turn the engine on for 5 minutes, turn it off and check again.</p><h2>How does the charging system of your 500 work?</h2><p>The charging system provides energy to the whole car, and it is composed of:</p><ul><li>The alternator</li><li>The voltage regulator</li><li>The battery</li></ul><p><strong>The alternator</strong></p><p>The alternator creates electricity. This cylindric item transforms mechanical energy into electrical energy. Thanks to the accessory belt, also called Poli-V, it receives the mechanical movement of the engine that will be transformed into electrical energy.</p><p><strong>The voltage regulator</strong></p><p>The voltage regulator is in charge of regulating and stabilizing the voltage created by the alternator while taking into account that the higher the rotational speed is, the higher the voltage created by the alternator will be. This device is a small electrical module that is inside the alternator itself.</p><p><strong>The battery</strong></p><p>The battery is where the generated electrical energy is stored to be used when the engine is off or when the required electricity levels are very high, for example, when we turn the car on.</p><p>The electrical system of a car is measured in volts (V), just like in homes, but, unlike these, the voltage used in batteries only has 12 V of continuous current, which makes it safer to handle.

If you cover your face, your hands or face may get injured.<br><br>⚠️ Airbags <strong>cannot be reused</strong>: once they have been deployed, you must replace them with new ones.<br><br>⚠️ <strong>Do not place any object in the areas where these airbags are located (not even your hands or feet).</strong> You can read the next section to know where the airbags are located, or you can read the <a href=\"/abarth/500/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.</p><h2>What kinds of airbags are there for your 500?</h2><p>There are many types of airbags according to their location in the car. The most common ones can be found inside of the space designed for both the driver and the passengers, but there are also external airbags to protect any passersby, although not all cars have them. You can read the <a href=\"/abarth/500/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> to know more about your car’s airbags.</p><p><strong>Internal airbags:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Front driver airbag: </strong>it protects the thorax and the head of the driver if there is a frontal collision. It is located in the middle of the steering wheel, and it is the most common one.</li><li><strong>Front passenger airbag: </strong>it is like the airbag for driver, but located inside of the glove box.</li><li><strong>Knee airbags: </strong>they protect the driver and the passenger from any leg and calf injuries. They are placed under the steering wheel and the glove box.</li><li><strong>Side airbags: </strong>they protect the passengers in case of side collisions by preventing their bodies from crashing into the car. They may be inside of the seats or inside of the bodywork.</li><li><strong>Curtain airbags: </strong>they protect the passengers in case of side collisions. They are mounted in the roof above the side doors and, when they activate, they cover the internal side of the cabin, both the front and the back seats. They diminish the collision with the bodywork and protect passengers from getting hurt by broken window glass.</li><li><strong>Rear airbags:</strong> They protect the heads of rear passengers. You can usually find them in compact cars. They cover the rear window in case of a collision.</li></ul><p><strong>External airbags:</strong></p><p>These airbags activate outside of the bodywork.

This system works thanks to certain sensors placed strategically in the bodywork of the car and they are controlled by certain electronic modules. If there is a collision, the car will determine how strong it is and which airbags should be deployed.</p><p>As this system is usually very complex, if you notice any anomaly or if you see a warning light indicating that something is damaged, you should take your car to a specialist as soon as you can. Since these airbags are so important for both your and the other passengers’ safety, you should always have an expert deal with them.</p><h2>When do the airbags get activated in your 500?</h2><p>When the <strong>car sensors</strong> sense a collision, they send a signal to the car’s <strong>computer</strong>. If the computer decides that the collision is strong enough, it deploys the airbags to protect the people in the car.</p><p>Moments after they have been deployed, the airbags begin to deflate to cushion the collision of the body. This whole cycle happens at a great speed in hundredths of a second.</p><p>Once the airbags have been deployed, they are no longer useful; a specialist should replace them with new ones.</p><h2><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/airbags_externos.jpg\"></div></h2>"

Almost all of them work in the same way: the fluid goes through one or more sheets of porous paper in which these impurities are caught.</p><p><strong>⚠️ There is one main problem with filters:</strong></p><p>As time goes on, particles are accumulated in the filters and <strong>overload</strong> them, so the fluids (either fuel, air, or oil) cannot flow through them anymore. When this happens, we say that <strong>the filter is “clogged.”</strong></p><h2>When should you change the filters of your 595?</h2><ul><li><strong>Air filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> They must usually be replaced every <strong>7,000 miles.</strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_aire_admision.jpg\"></div>Purpose: they purify the air that gets into the cylinders. It catches any impurities that may be in the air, such as dirt, sand, plant remains, bugs, etc. It is essential to keep the internal surfaces of both cylinders and piston rings clean, which also diminishes their wear.  It is found inside the engine compartment, inside of a plastic black box (air cleaner case).</li><li><strong>Fuel filter</strong>:   <strong></strong>Fuel filters should be replaced <strong>every 10,000 miles or once a year</strong>.

It prevents the injectors, as well as some other parts of the fuel feed system, from getting dirty. In Diesel cars, they also catch the water that may be in the fuel.This filter is usually close to the fuel tank in gasoline cars, and you can access it right under it. On the other hand, in Diesel cars, this filter is placed inside the engine compartment.</li><li><strong>Motor oil filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> They must usually be replaced <strong>every 5,000 - 10,000 miles (when you change the oil).</strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_aceite.jpg\"></div>Purpose: one of the purposes of the motor oil is to clean the engine and prevent dirt from sticking into metallic surfaces. The dirt transported by the oil is caught in the filter to prevent it from flowing into the engine. It also catches any metallic pieces that come from the engine wear. It is essential to keep the wear of all the internal parts of the engine to a minimum. It is attached to the engine block (monobloc), in front or next to the engine.</li><li><strong>Transmission fluid filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> Replace it or at least clean it every time you change the transmission fluid.

They are placed inside of the ventilation duct, on the passenger seat’s side.</li></ul><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">⚠️ <strong>Warning</strong>: sometimes, the <strong>change periods vary a lot</strong> depending on how much dirt these filters have accumulated. For example, if you drive in areas where there is a lot of dust in the air, you will have to change the air and cabin filters more frequently than if you drive in a city. The same happens with fuel filters: if the fuel you use is not of good quality, it would be better to change it more frequently.</p><p>We have stated the standard periods to change these filters, but you should always change them according to the periods stated in your  595‘s  <a href=\"/abarth/595/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.</p><p>Please take into account that some filters are more important than others since they have an impact on the way the car works, but all of them <strong>should be checked periodically</strong> by you or by a specialist.</p>",

This information is later used by the central computer of your 595 (ECU or PCM) to control the fuel injection and allow the engine to work efficiently without wasting fuel or reducing its efficiency.</p><p>The exhaust system may have 1 or 2 oxygen sensors. The main one is in the inlet of the catalytic converter, and it monitors the gases that come out of the engine. The second one (if your car has one) is in the catalytic converter outlet, and its purpose is to monitor its performance. It is important to remember that if the catalytic converter malfunctions, extremely pollutant gases will be released into the atmosphere. The oxygen sensor usually begins to fail after the car has driven from <strong>55,000 to 90,000 miles (90,000 to 140,000 km), </strong>and that is when you should replace it. If it is working correctly, you do not have to replace it. Take into account that this is not an essential component with set maintenance periods, even if it helps your 595 work efficiently by reducing its emissions, and it also helps extend the engine lifespan. <strong>The oxygen sensor usually malfunctions when a lot of dirt has been accumulated </strong>due to the wrong fuel type or low-quality fuel usage. <strong>Most of the time </strong>you just need to clean it for it to go back to normal.</p><h2>Signs that show that your 595‘s oxygen sensor is faulty</h2><p>You will usually notice that the oxygen sensor is faulty when the <strong>idle speed is unstable</strong>, there is increased fuel consumption, and the <strong>check engine light</strong> comes on (you can see this light below). </p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/testigo_check_engine.png\"></div><p></p>",

This sensor is small, and its parts are immovable. It has a small hose that is placed in a hole that leads to the inside of the air circuit.</p><p>To function, the engine always tries to draw air in, but the butterfly valve blocks it partially. This creates a depression (a “negative” pressure) inside the intake manifold. It is like sucking the air in an empty plastic bottle. The faster the engine spins, and/or, the tighter this butterfly valve is closed, the bigger this depression will get. With this and some other pieces of information, the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) estimates the engine load (the burden placed on the engine) and adjusts the fuel injection to keep its optimal performance and minimize its fuel consumption.</p><h2>Signs that show that your 595‘s MAP sensor is faulty</h2><ul><li>The <em>Check engine</em> light comes on</li><li>Erratic speed: sometimes you cannot speed up, the acceleration may be slow, or your car may decelerate</li><li>Increased smoke emissions</li></ul><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️ <strong>Some other problems may cause symptoms similar to those of a faulty MAP sensor</strong>, for example, vacuum leaks.

You should have a specialist check it out if that is the case.<br><br><strong>⚠️ Under no circumstances should you open the hood or the coolant reservoir. If you do that, the liquid may be ejected upwards, and you may get burned.</strong></p><h2>What kind of coolant should you use in your 595?</h2><p><strong></strong> There are a lot of different types and brands of coolants, and each one has its particular characteristics. You should always use the kind of coolant indicated in the  <a href=\"/abarth/595/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>. Like this, your  595‘s engine will be thoroughly protected. If there is an emergency, you can use a coolant with glycol, no matter their color (they may be either green or pink). Afterward, when you have time, you can check the specific type of coolant your car needs.<strong></strong></p><h2><strong></strong><p></p></h2><h2>How do I prevent my 595 from overheating?</h2><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">There are some overheating causes that you can easily prevent yourself:<br><br><strong>-  Always use high-quality coolants:</strong> change the coolant every 30,000 miles (50,000 kilometers) or after 2 years. If you want to know more about this, you should read the  <a href=\"/abarth/595/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.<br><br><strong>- Never use water </strong>(either distilled or tap water): the coolant has certain qualities that are very important for the correct performance of the system. For example, it boils at a higher temperature.<br><br><strong>- Check the coolant level every 15 days: </strong>keep the coolant level up to the level indicated in the coolant reservoir.<br><br><strong>- Clean the radiator fins: </strong>the radiator may gather some garbage such as leaves, mud, or dust that clogs its airflow and its cooling qualities will decrease. Clean it with a brush every time you check the coolant level.</p><h2>Why does my 595‘s engine overheat?</h2><p>There are two main causes for engine overheat:</p><ol type=\"1\"><li>The coolant does not flow through the system like it should</li><li>There is not enough air flowing through the radiator</li></ol><p><em>⚠️ The coolant does not flow through the system like it should. These may be some of the causes:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Not enough coolant: </strong>check the coolant level periodically. If the level is under the minimum level recommended, the engine may overheat because there is not enough coolant.</li><li><strong>The pump may be worn out:</strong> it is advisable to change the pump every time you change the timing belt, since there is an excellent cost-benefit relationship.</li><li><strong>Clogged radiator: </strong>the internal tubes are small and, as time goes on, if the coolant is not refilled periodically, dirt accumulates and blocks these ducts.</li><li><strong>Clogged engine ducts:</strong> just like the previous item, but in the internal engine ducts.</li><li><strong>Thermostat not opening: </strong>thermostats usually become unresponsive because of the dirt or internal damage, which prevents the coolant from circulating through the radiator and cooling down.</li></ul><p><em>⚠️ There is not enough air flowing through the radiator. These may be some of the reasons:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Clogged radiator fins: </strong>the radiator may gather some garbage such as leaves, mud, or dust that clogs its air flow and its cooling qualities will decrease.</li><li><strong>Bent radiator fins: </strong>if you are not careful, you do not handle them carefully, or pressure-wash them, the fins will get bet until they block most of the airflow.</li><li><strong>The electric fan does not work:</strong> the electric fan might be damaged. If the temperature sensor or the control module are damaged, it may also stop working.</li></ul><p><em>⚠️ Other causes:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Poor-quality coolant:</strong> you should always use the coolant recommended in the owner’s manual, and renew it after the specified time period, which is usually every 5 years.</li><li><strong>Broken or loose radiator or reservoir cap: </strong>the cooling circuit must work while it is under pressure. If the caps are damaged or loose, this pressure and the liquid will leak.</li><li><strong>Not enough lubricant:</strong> when the friction between the internal pieces increase, the temperature and the wear increase significantly, and this may cause severe damages if it is not fixed on time.</li><li><strong>The cylinder heads may be broken: </strong>the combustion gases get into the refrigeration system, and this will increase the temperature and form gas bubbles.</li></ul><h2>How does the system that cools the engine of your 595 work?</h2><p>All engines have a cooling system, which works by taking the heat from the engine to the radiator.</p><p>This system is quite simple, and it includes the following parts:</p><ul><li>Coolant</li><li>Radiator</li><li>Coolant pump</li><li>Temperature sensor</li><li>Thermostat</li><li>Electric fan</li></ul><p>The engine cools thanks to the <strong>coolant</strong>, or “antifreeze.” You can usually buy it at gas stations when you “check the fluids.” It is typically green or pink. <strong>You must never use just water; this will damage the engine in a very short time period.</strong></p><p>You can see how this system works in the following image: the liquid takes the heat generated by the engine and takes it to the <strong>radiator</strong>. There is a <strong>pump </strong>that makes the liquid flow, and it pushes it along the circuit. The hot liquid enters through the upper part of the radiator, and it comes out being cool from the bottom part.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/bbb1b168_Sin título1.png\"></div><p></p><p>In order to keep its good performance, the engine of your 595 must always stay within the optimal temperature range, which is usually around 190ºF (90°C). To guarantee this temperature, the system has two “auxiliary” pieces that control temperatures: the thermostat and the electric fan. The <strong>thermostat </strong>prevents the coolant from cooling too much, and the <strong>electric fan</strong> stops it from heating.</p><p>The<strong> temperature sensor</strong> monitors the whole system that is usually controlled by the central computer or by a separate electronic module, depending on the car manufacturer.</p><p>Like in every system, any of these parts may malfunction or get damaged, and that will make the engine overheat, as we explained above.</p>",

Moreover, if the car has a diesel engine, this system will also block the “stop” relay, which will prevent the fuel from being injected into the engine. Sometimes, this system will also block the steering column which will lock the steering wheel.</p><h2>Why is the immobilizer activated on a 595?</h2><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">The main reason is because the car's computer does not recognize or does not detect the signal sent by the chip which is inside the key. The most common reasons as to why this happens are:<br><br>⚠️ <strong>Low battery of the key or the remote control:</strong> the chip will not send the signal.<br><br>⚠️<strong> The chip of the key is damaged or has been decoded</strong>: it may happen if the key is damaged or if it gets wet.<br><br>⚠️ <strong>Faulty electrical wiring:</strong> it may happen both in the antenna as well as in the immobilizer unit or the engine's computer.</p><p>Less frequent causes:</p><ul><li><strong>Damaged antenna</strong>: due to electrical reasons, the antenna may stop working.</li><li><strong>Lack of synchronization of the immobilizer unit.</strong></li><li><strong>Electronic failure</strong>: any of the contacts or internal electronic components of the module or the computer may get damaged.</li></ul><h2>How can I fix an immobilizer problem on a 595?</h2><p>Since this system is delicate, it is advisable to leave this process in the hands of a specialist.</p><p>First, the technician will <strong>scan the car</strong> with the adequate diagnosis equipment to check if the problem is actually related to the immobilizer system.</p><p>If that is the case, the technician will have to identify the cause among the causes already mentioned and then see if this problem can be solved via programming or if it is necessary to replace any of the components.</p><h2>How does the immobilizer or anti-theft system or your 595 work?</h2><p>Each <strong>original key</strong> has a chip inside which sends a signal when it gets close to the ignition switch. Inside the switch there is an antenna which receives this signal and sends it to the car's computer. If the signal is the same as the one the car has saved, then the driver will be allowed to start the car.</p><p>The immobilizer is automatic and manual activation is never needed.

It is commonly said that the oil is \"heavier\" when it is more viscous and \"lighter\" in the opposite case. Viscosity grades are measured based on SAE standards. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p>We advise you to look for the recommended viscosity in your <a href=\"/abarth/595/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> or ask your trusted mechanic. If you can’t find the information and you have to change the engine oil, this is what you have to know: </p><p>When engines work at low temperatures (engine start), the oil should be more fluid in order to reach every part of the engine and ensure immediate lubrication. After a few minutes, the temperature of the engine will rise and, ideally, the oil viscosity should be higher. This ensures proper lubrication without breaking the lubricant film. Nowadays, all oils meet this requirement and they are called <strong>multigrade oils </strong>(lower viscosity at cold temperatures and higher viscosity at hot temperatures).</p><p><strong>A medium viscosity level would be the SAE 10W-40 engine oil</strong>, which meet the needs of the current car models without difficulty.</p><p>If you live in a place where the temperature drops to 14° F (-10° C) or less you should use an oil with lower viscosity (5W-40 for example).<strong></strong></p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\"> ⚠️ If your vehicle has over 124,000 mi and consumes oil or you see some white smoke coming from the exhaust pipe, you can use an oil with a slightly higher viscosity to compensate for wear. </p><h2>Which engine oil should your 595 use?</h2><p><strong></strong>You can find the specific engine oil quality for your 595 in <strong>the Maintenance section </strong>of your <a href=\"/abarth/595/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.

Its quality is the lowest comparing to the other oils because it degrades and loses its properties faster, to which is added the dirt build-up in the engine.</li><li><strong>Synthetic oil</strong>: It’s a product with specific properties. Of the three oils, it is the one with <strong>the highest quality and durability.</strong></li><li><strong>Semi synthetic oil</strong>: It’s a mixture of mineral and synthetic oil.

                        "<h2>When do I have to change the motor oil of my 595?</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In short: <br></strong>According to the <strong>type</strong> of oil your car uses, you should change it every 3,000, 5,000, or 6,000 miles. If in a year your 595 still has not covered the mentioned distance, you should still change it.</p><p>Your 595 needs to have its oil changed every:</p><p><strong></strong></p><ul><li>3,000 miles (5,000 km) if you use mineral oil</li><li>5,000 to 6,000 miles (8,000 to 10,000 km) if you use semi-synthetic oil</li><li>6,000 to 9,000 miles (10,000 to 15,000 km) if you use synthetic oil</li></ul><p>You should always follow the instructions written in the oil container.<strong></strong></p><p>Synthetic oil is the best type of oil for your 595. It is more expensive than the others, but you will not have to change it so frequently, you will be able to use it for the mentioned period without any problems, and it will be better for your car’s engine.</p><p>If you want to know more about which kind of oil you should use, you can read our  <a class=\"\" href=\"/abarth/595/guides/what-engine-oil-does-my-car-need\">\n                <span class=\"\">motor oil guide</span>\n              </a></p><p> To keep your car in ideal conditions, knowing when to change its motor oil is one of the most essential and fundamental things you need to know. However, you should also take into account these vital recommendations:</p><ul><li><strong>You must get your car’s oil changed after a year of usage</strong>, even if your vehicle has not covered the indicated mileage yet.</li><li>Every time you <strong>change the motor oil</strong>, you should also <strong>change the oil filter</strong>. It is cheap, and it ensures that the oil will be perfectly filtered.</li><li><strong>Use the most popular oil brands. </strong>These are not always the most expensive ones, and they will undoubtedly bring about the best results.</li><li><strong>Never use synthetic oil in a car that used mineral oil up to then.</strong> This oil will remove the dirt so suddenly that the ducts and the oil filter will get clogged. If you want to change the type of oil your car uses, you should first use semi-synthetic oil and see what happens. This oil may remove the engine dirt, but not too suddenly and not all of it.</li></ul><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠ ️ <strong>Never use monograde oils!</strong> Even if they are the cheapest, they will surely ruin the engine of your  595.</p>",
                        "<h2>What styles of car bodies exist?</h2><p>The body of a car is <strong>the space where the passengers and the cargo are placed.</strong> In promotional pamphlets, you usually read words like Sedan, Minivan, SUV, Hatchback, etc. All of them are related to the <strong>car body style</strong>. In this article, we will tell you how to classify different car bodies and their particular features.</p><h2>Types according to body configuration</h2><p>According to their configuration, car bodies can be distinguished from each other because of their <strong>designs, that is to say, their geometrical structure is well-defined</strong>. In these images, you can see their shapes highlighted in color. The type will change according to the number of boxes their design has:</p><ul><li><strong>One-box design, monospace or monovolume: </strong>the car body does not have any divisions; it has a one-box design. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/55a7faf1_Monovolumen.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Two-box design: </strong>they have two volumes.

In this list, the number of doors and the way the trunk is opened, among other characteristics, will be included. In this group, the different car styles will be <strong>grouped esthetically</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Sedan: </strong>it has a three-box design with four doors. It is the most common car, and you can see it has a front section (hood), a middle section (cabin), and a rear section (trunk). <strong>It has a horizontal trunk lid that does not include the glass of the rear window.</strong><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/c46c58ee_SEDAN FINAL.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Berlina: </strong>it is very similar to sedan cars, but <strong>the trunk lid does include the glass of the rear window</strong>. This means that you can enter the cabin through the trunk. That is why this design is said to have five doors. Esthetically speaking, if we compare them to sedan cars, the trunk seems smaller in comparison to the cabin.  <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/6e2e8048_berlina.png\"></div></li><li><strong>Station wagon: </strong>they have a two-box design where the <strong>cabin </strong>and the <strong>trunk share a volume</strong>.

                        "<h2>What is the IAC valve of your 595?</h2><p>The IAC valve (Idle Air Control valve) is designed to keep a steady idle speed. The idle speed, also known simply as “idle,” is the amount of revolutions that the engine keeps when our foot is not pressing the accelerator. The IAC valve is controlled by the computer and it balances any burden upon the engine, like the usage of the air conditioner, the lights or the sound system. When the engine is cold, it helps it start by keeping the revolutions somewhat higher until the engine heats up.</p><h2>Symptoms that show that your 595‘s IAC valve is failing</h2><ul><li>The engine stalls when the car is idling (idle speed)</li><li>It is hard to start the vehicle when the engine is cold</li><li>Unstable revolutions that go up and down</li><li>The engine stalls if the air conditioner is turned on</li><li>The “check engine” light comes on</li></ul><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️ You should check the IAC valve periodically to make sure it is clean, since it usually malfunctions because of the accumulation of carbon residue which is produced by the combustion of the engine.</p>",

It should not move more than 1 inch (2.5cm).<br>- The booster seat should be <strong>facing the rear until the child is four years old.</strong><br>- Make sure to <strong>check the anchor of the seat periodically</strong>. Research has shown that <strong>3 out of 5 booster seats are not fixed properly</strong>.</p><h2>How should children travel in your 595?</h2><p>Children should always be <strong>restrained by booster seats; </strong>they must never roam freely inside the car or sit in your lap. This should be the case <strong>until they are at least 51 inches tall</strong> (1.4 meters). This system is generically known as child restraint system.</p><p>In most countries, the law states that children should be facing the rear up until they are one year old, but specialists have stated that they should sit that way <strong>until they are four years old</strong> because that is when their cervical muscles can endure a frontal collision without getting badly injured.</p><p>Children may stop using booster seats when:</p><ul><li>They can <strong>bend their knees</strong> naturally while sitting down with their hip touching the back of the seat.</li><li><strong>The chest safety belt</strong> is on <strong>their shoulders,</strong> and not their necks.</li><li><strong>The abdominal safety belt </strong>is on their hip, between their legs and abdomen.</li></ul><p>Although many countries regulate this depending on the child’s age, and not their size, <strong>you should always consider your children’s weight and height</strong>, not their age.</p><h2>Can you use any kind of booster seat in your 595?</h2><p><strong>NO.</strong> Booster seats for children <strong>are classified</strong> into different groups according to the <strong>child’s size and weight</strong>. They also include different <strong>anchors</strong> for the seat: the <strong>traditional </strong>system (with a safety belt), <strong>ISOFIX,</strong> or <strong>LATCH</strong>. You should choose the right one both for your children and your car. If you want to know which one to use, you should read the <a href=\"/abarth/595/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> of your 595. Take into account that different brands may have different ways to anchor the seats, but they should always be <strong>certified according to the regulations</strong> we will now mention.</p><h2>Booster seat sizes</h2><p>Booster seats can be categorized according to the 3 main safety regulations: the <strong>FMVSS 213</strong> (American) and european <strong>ECE R44</strong> and <strong>UN R129</strong> (a.k.a. <strong>i-Size</strong>, newer and more complete). R44 categorizes according to the weight of the child, i-Size is based on height and the american FMV is a mix between both.</p><p class=\"ArticleWarning\"><strong>The American regulation has three groups:</strong><br><br><strong>Infant:</strong> for children whose size is up to 32 inches (or 0.8 meters) and their weight between 4 and 35 pounds (or 2 to 16 kilograms). These seats are meant to face the rear.<br><br><strong>Convertible: </strong>for children whose size is between 19 and 45 inches (or 0.5 and 1.2 meters). They are meant for children who are between 5 and 40 pounds (or 2 to 18 kilograms), and you should place them facing the rear, unless the child’s weight is between 20 and 65 pounds (or between 9 and 30 kilograms), since they can already face forward at that point.<br><br><strong>Booster</strong>: Up to 65 inches (or 1.65 meters) and 120 pounds (55 kilograms).

You can use the former in any car because they can be anchored with a seatbelt. Semi-universal seats are called  <strong>LATCH</strong> seats (according to the American regulations) and <strong>ISOFIX</strong> (according to the European regulations). They both use anchors specifically designed, which are located in the car seats.

                        "<h2> Exhaust smoke and its colors on a 595: causes and severity</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In a few words:</strong><br>According to the color of the exhaust smoke that is released from the exhaust pipe of your 595 you will be able to identify the possible causes. The colors of the exhaust smoke that your 595 may produce will help you find the problem. In <strong>order of priority </strong>from the least to the most dangerous, these colors are:<strong> white, blue, black, mix of two colors</strong>.</p><p>First, it should be said that the exhaust gas that is usually released through the exhaust pipe of your car is basically <strong>invisible</strong>. You should see a faint and short-lived exhaust that fades shortly after appearing only if you speed up abruptly. If your 595 discharges visible exhaust smoke then it is very likely that you need to take it to a specialist.</p><h2>White exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a 595</h2><p>The exhaust gas that comes out without strength and elevates considerably (it may get over the roof) but then fades without any trace when your car is idling may only be <strong>water vapor.</strong> This exhaust does not smell like anything in particular and it can be seen if the temperature is low or if there is humidity. <strong>If this is the case, do not worry.</strong></p><p><strong>If the white exhaust smoke does not fade, it is dense and smells, then</strong> it is associated with a <strong>coolant leak</strong>. In this case, the <strong>coolant level</strong> of your 595 <strong>should be low</strong>. Have your car checked up by a specialist to confirm this leak and prevent your engine from overheating.</p><p>⚠️<strong> Check the recovery tank. </strong>If you see that the <strong>coolant is bubbling</strong> that means that it is leaking into the combustion chamber. This is caused by a leak of exhaust gases into the cooling system. If your car has these symptoms <strong>you should</strong> <strong>have your engine checked</strong> by a specialist at once since this malfunction may bring serious problems.</p><p>This liquid leak may be caused by the following reasons:</p><ul><li>The cylinder head gasket is damaged (which is the cheapest problem to fix)</li><li>The cylinder head or the engine block are cracked (which is more expensive)</li></ul><h2>Blue exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a 595</h2><p>At first sight this exhaust smoke seems white but it has a <strong>blueish tone, a certain density and a particular smell, like something is burning. </strong>Moreover, its <strong>volume increases significantly when you step on the accelerator.</strong></p><p>This blue exhaust smoke indicates that the <strong>lubricant oil is burning</strong>, either because there is a leak into the inside of the combustion chamber or a leak into the exhaust system.</p><p>⚠️ <strong>Check if the level of lubricant oil</strong> of your 595 <strong>is decreasing drastically</strong> to verify if that is the cause.</p><p>The causes for this lubricant leak are usually the following:</p><ul><li><strong>The valve stem seals are in a bad shape</strong></li><li>The <strong>piston rings are worn down</strong></li><li>Leaks of oil in the supercharger (if the engine of you 595 has this system)</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, fixing any of these problems is expensive and they usually affect<strong> high mileage engines</strong> (with more than 90,000 miles) or cars with <strong>badly battered engines</strong>.</p><p><strong>If the exhaust smoke is blue but it is not too dense</strong>, it may be caused by a blockage in the crankcase ventilation system.</p><p>⚠️ In this case, <strong>the exhaust smoke will come from the engine and not from the exhaust pipe</strong>.</p><p>It is normal to see blueish exhaust coming from the exhaust pipe of mopeds and motorbikes with a two-stroke engine, and, in those cases, this exhaust is not caused by a failure.</p><h2>Black exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a 595</h2><p>This problem <strong>is usually seen in diesel engines</strong> and it is caused by a <strong>great increase in the amount of fuel supplied to the engine</strong>, that is to say, the engine is burning more fuel than it should.</p><p>⚠️ Check if the <strong>consumption of fuel</strong> of your 595 <strong>has increased significantly</strong>.<strong> You should also notice</strong> this because of <strong>the reduction of power </strong>of the engine.</p><p>You can also verify this flaw by <strong>putting a white cloth inside the exhaust pipe, clogging it up for a few seconds</strong>. This cloth will <strong>turn black</strong> instantly due to the expelled coal particles.</p><p>This black color is caused by the generation of hydrocarbons that are not completely burnt. They create more <strong>carbonaceous particles</strong> which soil the lubricant oil and they settle in each nook and cranny of the engine of your 595. At the same time, they are also accumulated inside the combustion chamber as hard crusts that are abrasive and wear down movable pieces.</p><p>The exhaust system is also affected because of the accumulation of cinder, which also poses a threat to the catalytic converter, the particle filter or the muffler of the car.</p><p>This problem may be caused by any of the following items:</p><ul><li>The air filter is too dirty.</li><li>The fuel injectors, the fuel pressure regulator, the throttle position sensor (TPS), or the Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor are dirty or there is an electrical flaw in them.</li><li>The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve is malfunctioning (this valve recirculates the exhaust gases back to the engine). When you accelerate, this EGR valve remains open so that the exhaust gases can get inside the engine once again.</li></ul><h2>Two-colored exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a 595</h2><p>In the worst case scenario the released exhaust will be two-colored. This means that there are many simultaneous causes for this problem and it is important that a specialist investigates this as soon as possible to prevent further failures.</p>",
                        "<h2>What do the technical specifications of your 595’s engine mean?</h2><p>Even though all engines are very similar when you look at them, there are many different types. We will now show you what the most usual technical specifications that you can find in the <strong>technical datasheet</strong> of your <strong> 595 </strong>mean.</p><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Gasoline or Diesel engines</strong><br><br>This is the main difference between engines. Engines that need Diesel have incandescent spark plugs that only work when the car starts. Once the engine is running, the fuel ignites by itself since it is compressed inside the cylinders thanks to the high temperature it reaches.<br>On the other hand, gasoline engines work thanks to the spark constantly created by the spark plugs. This means that they work all the time the engine is running.<br>Another difference between these two engines is that Diesel engines are generally heavier, and their structure is more robust.</li><li><strong>Number of cylinders</strong><br><br>It is the <strong>number</strong> of cylinders inside the engine. <strong>The engine power is generated </strong>in the cylinders because that is where the pistons are. For this reason, the more cylinders the engine has, the more its power will be. This also means that the engine will be bigger and heavier. It is also important to notice that if there are a lot of cylinders, the engine will consume more fuel. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/bloque.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Bore/stroke ratio</strong><br><br><strong>These are the piston’s measurements, </strong>and they can be expressed in centimeters or inches. They indicate the cylinder diameter (bore) and the longitudinal displacement (stroke) that the piston does inside the cylinder when the engine is running. These measurements allow us to measure the “displaced volume” by the piston. <strong>If the diameter is wide and the piston has a short stroke, the engine will be fit for sports cars.</strong> In other words, the revolutions per minute (RPMs) will be high.  <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/cf9931c1_carrera y diametro.png\"></div></li><li><strong>Engine displacement</strong><br><br>It is the total available volume in the engine cylinders. It is calculated by multiplying the stroke length, the bore, and the number of cylinders.<br>Depending on the country, it may be expressed in liters (1.6 L, 2.0 L, 3.6 L), or in cubic inches (98, 110, 250, 510 CI).<br>Generally, <strong>the higher the engine displacement is, the more power your car will have, but the higher its fuel consumption will be.</strong></li><li><strong>Cylinder arrangement</strong><br><br>a) In-line arrangement: nowadays, it is hard to find engines with more than 6 in-line cylinders because they take up too much space under the hood.<br><br>b) V-type arrangement: They are more compact and create fewer vibrations, but they can only be used with an even number of cylinders (V6, V8, V10, etc.).<br><br>c) Opposed arrangement: they are flat and not frequently used because their manufacture and maintenance are very demanding. Moreover, like the V-type arrangement, they can only be used with an even number of cylinders. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/tipo_de_motor.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Valvetrain type: SOHC and DOHC</strong><br><br>a) SOHC (single overhead camshaft):  It only has one camshaft placed in the cylinder head. Only one camshaft controls all the engine’s valves. They generally have more power if there are low RPMs. The camshaft is in charge of opening and closing the engine’s valves.<br>b) DOHC (double overhead camshaft): It has two camshafts placed in the cylinder head. One camshaft controls the admission valve while the other controls the escape valve. The performance of these engines is usually better if the RPMs are high. Moreover, its parts are usually lighter and can move faster.</li><li><strong>Compression ratio</strong><br><br><strong>It is the measurement of how much the volume of the air-fuel mixture can be compressed inside of the cylinder.</strong> The higher this number is, the higher the engine power will be. For example, if there is an 8:1 ratio, this means that the mixture will be reduced to one octave of its original volume.<br>Generally, compression ratios are between 8:1 and 12:1 for gasoline engines.</li><li><strong>Naturally aspirated or turbo engines</strong><br><br>A <strong>naturally aspired</strong> engine means <strong>that the engine draws air directly through an air intake.</strong> In turbocharged cars, on the other hand,<strong> the turbocharger injects air by forcing it into the engine.</strong> The advantage of using turbochargers is that, in small engines, the power increases because it is possible to inject more air and fuel into the cylinders.</li><li><strong> Torque</strong><br><br><strong>It is the “strength” that the engine has when it accelerates.</strong><br>It is measured in “foot-pounds” or in “N.m” (1 N.m = 0.737 ft.lb), and to express it, the RPM of the engine must also be stated. For example: 150 N.m @ 1700 RPM.<br>Off-road cars usually have a lot of torque and not so much power. This enables them to drive up big slopes at a slow speed or dodge big pits and rocks. Diesel engines have more torque than gasoline engines.</li><li><strong> Power</strong><br><br><strong>It is the car’s ability to accelerate (to react) at high speeds.</strong><br>It is measured in HP (Horse Power), or in KW (1 HP = 0.745 KW).</li><li><strong> Revolutions per minute (RPM)</strong><br><br><strong>They represent the engine speed. It is important to distinguish them from the car speed since they are not the same thing.</strong> Both are related by the transmission. For example, if the car is in neutral gear and we press the accelerator, we may only change the engine speed but not the car speed.<br>Technically speaking: <em>Torque x RPM = Power</em><br>In a car, the RPM are controlled by the accelerator. Their rise depends on how much we press the accelerator, and this will be reflected in the tachometer. The higher the RPMs are, the noisier the engine will be.</li></ol>",

They are cheap, disposable and there are <strong>different types</strong> according to their usage and the amount of <strong>amperage</strong> they transmit.<br>There are Bosch fuses (or torpedo or GCB), cylinder fuses (or cartridge) made of glass, blade (or spade) fuses, cartridge fuses (JSCASE and MCASE), and high current fuses. The same car may have up to 3 types of fuses for its different circuits.</p><p>Fuses are pieces that <strong>protect the electrical circuits</strong>. That is to say, every time an electrical component of your 595 <strong>suddenly stops working</strong>, there might be a <strong>blown fuse</strong>. The good news is that fuses are really <strong>cheap and easy to replace</strong>. For this reason, before you mourn the loss of your stereo, air conditioner, or other devices, you should first check these little pieces.</p><p>All of them work in the same way and, the other good news is that they have no front or backside, so they are <strong>easy to put into place</strong>. Despite their small size, they have a <strong>calibrated conductor for the highest current they can withstand</strong>, and if the current goes over this value, the conductor breaks, which interrupts the circuit and makes it impossible for the current to keep on flowing. The visible result is that the system stops working, but it is just because there is no current, not because of a serious problem.</p><p>Each type of fuse has a <strong>normalized value </strong>that can be easily recognizable because it is <strong>engraved in its body</strong>.</p><p>You can see where the fuse box of your 595 is located and what each fuse protects in the <a href=\"/abarth/595/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.</p><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️Every time you change a fuse, you should do it while your 595 is turned off.</p><h2>Fuse types</h2><p>There are many fuse types, but these are the most common in the automotive industry:</p><p><strong>Blade (or spade) fuses:</strong></p><p>They are used in vehicles manufactured since the year 2000 up to now.</p><p>They have a rectangular shape, a flat contour, and a plastic, transparent body.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/e69d5b39_500px-Electrical_fuses,_blade_type.svg.png\"></div><p></p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\"><strong>There are many different sizes:</strong><br><br>Micro2 (APT - ATR)  -  with 5 to 30 amperes.<br>Micro3 (ATL)  -  with 5 to 15 amperes.<br>Low profile Mini (APS), wrongly known as \"micro\" - with 2 to 30 amperes.<br>Mini (ATM - APM) - their ends are smaller than those of Micro2 fuses -  with 2 to 30 amperes.<br>High/Regular/Standard - with 0.5 to 40 amperes.<br>Maxi (APX) - with 20 to 120 amperes.</p><p><strong>Cartridge fuses (JCASE and MCASE):</strong></p><p>They usually have a female connector, but there are also male ones.

                        "<h2>How to keep your 595 safe during extended periods without use</h2><p>If your 595 has to stay in one place for a long time, here are some recommendations to keep your car in the best possible condition.</p><p><strong>Battery:</strong> Disconnect the negative terminal of the battery. This will prevent the electrical components from consuming it, and it will prevent any future problems when you start your 595.</p><p><strong>Tires: </strong>Inflate your car’s tires with more pressure than the recommended one for driving. Either 3 or 4 psi should be enough. Like this, they will not get deformed when they naturally deflate.</p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">If you will not use your 595 for a few months, you can also create some sort of support with bricks (or any other elements) and place it under the chassis so that it can help the wheels hold the weight of the car when the wheels deflate.</p><p><strong>Fuel:</strong> Ideally, the fuel tank should be full. If there is less air inside of the tank, there is less probability of it evaporating. Additionally, like this, if the tank is metallic, you will prevent its rusting.</p><p><strong>Hand brake:</strong> You must never activate it unless it is really necessary. It has a wire in its mechanism, and if this wire stays taut for a long period, it may get damaged. Also the brake pad (brake shoe) may get stuck or corrode the pieces it is in contact with.</p><p><strong>Fluids and oils:</strong> Check that the levels of refrigerant, steering fluid, brake fluid, and oil of your 595 are the recommended ones.</p><p><strong>Start:</strong> If you can, start your 595 once every ten days. This will prevent the wear of the mechanical pieces of the engine, and it will recharge the battery. During those moments, you should also turn the air conditioner on, move the automatic windows and turn all the lights on and off. The movement of the circuits will keep your car in good shape.</p><p><strong>Exhaust pipe: </strong>Put a small cloth with motor oil in the external part of the exhaust pipe to prevent corrosion.</p><p><strong>Cleaning: </strong>Prevent bad smells and mold in the car by cleaning the inside of the car thoroughly. You may also leave some carbon or a cup with dry rice inside so that they will absorb humidity.</p><p>To keep the outside of the car clean, you can wax your car and then cover it with a car tarpaulin.</p><p></p>",
                        "<h2>What light bulbs fit your 595?</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In short:</strong><br>If one of your 595‘s bulbs burned out and you want to know which one you should buy to replace it, you can remove it and take it to an auto part store, or you can check the maintenance section found in the <a href=\"/abarth/595/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.<br>If you replaced the bulb but it is still not working, you should check the fuses.</p><p>Your 595 has bulbs that illuminate both the outside and the inside of the car. Since headlamps are more complex, there are many types. They are the ones that illuminate the road ahead without dazzling the other drivers. Brake lights are only there to be seen at a sensible distance by the drivers behind you, and their purpose is to light up when you press the brake pedal.</p><p><strong>Generally, changing these bulbs is easy,</strong> and you can do it yourself. Cars have a different lighting system from that of a house since they are guaranteed to keep working despite the vehicle’s vibrations. You only have to make sure that their <strong>pigtail wire has been properly connected</strong>. You will know they have been connected properly because <strong>there is only one way they can be connected</strong>.</p><p>You should <strong>have a spare bulb in your 595</strong> if you are about to go on a road trip. Even if <strong>a bulb has a lifespan of several years</strong>, they are cheap and it never hurts to be careful.</p><ul><li><strong>LED lamps</strong></li></ul><p>The main advantage of LED lamps is their <strong>efficiency</strong>: they produce <strong>a lot of light,</strong> and they <strong>draw less electrical energy (</strong>up to 80% less<strong>)</strong>. Moreover, their <strong>lifespan is 25 times longer</strong> than the lifespan of a halogen lamp. LED lamps are <strong>instantly on</strong> and, since the component that produces light is relatively small, these lamps can be created in any shape or form. They are made of semiconductor materials enclosed in a small, plastic shell and only one lamp may produce different colors.</p><p>There are a lot of high-end brands that use LED technology for their products, but their usage of fixed LED light panels makes it almost impossible for them to be changed without having to visit an authorized car dealer.</p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/0af84ef3_Untitled4-628x280.png\"></div><p></p><ul><li><strong>Incandescent lamps</strong></li></ul><p>They are the <strong>oldest ones, they consume a lot of energy and create a lot of heat.</strong> They are made up of a metallic filament which is protected by a transparent glass bulb. When the electricity goes through the filament, it turns bright red and it produces light. Nowadays, these lamps are still used to illuminate <strong>car interiors, dashboard lights, brake lights, direction-indicator lights, and front position lights</strong>, since these lights do not need to be too powerful. They have different watts, sizes, and shapes according to their usage. They may have 1 or 2 filaments (just like the brake lights).</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/e7ba5170_Incandenscentes.jpg\"></div><p></p><ul><li><strong>Halogen lamps</strong></li></ul><p><strong>They are the enhanced version of incandescent lamps.</strong> <strong>The light they produce is stronger and whiter.</strong> They work the same way; the only difference is that the glass bulb encloses halogen gas, which improves the filament’s output and, therefore, also enhances its lifespan. For these reasons, these lamps are more efficient, and small halogen lamps may be powerful.</p><p>These lamps may have <strong>different</strong> amounts of filaments, their filaments may be placed in different positions, and the shape of their bulbs may be different. The most common ones are these: </p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/412a152f_Halógenas2.jpg\"></div><p></p><p><strong>H1 lamps</strong>: <strong>They are used in fog lamps and high beam lights.</strong> They only have one filament placed longitudinally and they have a compact shape. There are 55, 70 and, 100-W H1 lamps.</p><p><strong>H3 lamps</strong>: They are usually used in <strong>fog lamps and long-range lights</strong>, and they have only one filament, which is placed transversely. They are the most compact ones. They only include a small wire to connect them. There are 55, 70 and 100-W H3 lamps.</p><p><strong>H4 lamps</strong>: They are the most used in <strong>headlamps because they can also be used as dipped beam headlights and high beam lights, which saves space.</strong> They have two filaments, and they are bigger than the other types of lamps. There are usually 55/60, 70/75, and 90/100-W H4 lamps (for crossings/highways).</p><p><strong>H7 lamps</strong>: They are mainly used in <strong>fog lamps</strong>. They only have one linear filament, and they are somewhat bigger than H1 and H3 lamps.</p><ul><li><strong>Xenon lamps</strong></li></ul><p><strong>They are the brightest ones,</strong> and the light they produce is whiter than the one made by halogen lamps. Their downside is that the electrical energy needed to turn these lamps on must be high (30,000 V). Their arc needs a high current, so they need auxiliary equipment called reactance, which is in charge of controlling the electrical energy of the lamp. If you are thinking of switching to Xenon’s lamps, an auto mechanic should do it for you.</p><p><strong>These lights take one minute to reach their maximum power.</strong> The good thing is that once you turn these lights on, they <strong>consume less electricity than halogen lamps</strong>, <strong>generate less heat and their lifespan is way longer.</strong> They are <strong>more expensive</strong> than the other lamps.</p><p>Regarding their structure, they do not have filaments. They have two electrodes, separated by a few millimeters protected by a glass bulb where there is high-pressure Xenon gas. An electrical arc that produces light is created between these two electrodes. You can see this light in the following image.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/5f306ae3_xenon-lampara3.jpg\"></div><p></p>",

If your car is very loaded, you could go up to 38 psi without  problems. For sport cars (with very low profile tires), the usual thing to do  is to  inflate them to<strong> ​40 psi​. </strong><br><strong>2- ​Look up the recommendation in your  <a href=\"/abarth/595/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a></strong>.  <br><strong>3- Look up the tag in your car. </strong>​You can find it sticked in the internal frame of the  driver’s door, in the fuel-charger lid or in the sun shield. It will look like this one you  can see here:  <br></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/c2f52106_Caclo de presion generica.JPG\"></div> <br><p></p><h2>How should I interpret the chart of the tires’ pressure of my  595? </h2><p>The tag with the recommended pressures varies according to the car’s  manufacturer. Here we show you an example where you will be able to see how to  interpret its data: </p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/etiqueta_neumaticos_2.PNG\"></div> <p></p><p>A - The columns on the right show the pressure of the back tires.  </p><p>B - The columns on the left show the pressure of the front tires. </p><p>C - If we read the  rows horizontally we will see that there is a recommended  pressure according to the load that our car will carry (represented in people and  luggage).  </p><p>D - The information that appears at the bottom is the recommended pressure for  your temporary auxiliary tire, which is not the same as the one recommended for the  rest of the tires, due to its smaller size. </p><p>E - The data ​T125/60​ and  R18 which appears in this example corresponds to the  measurements of the temporary auxiliary tire.  </p><p>Depending on the country of origin of your 595, the pressure of the tires  may be measured in  \"psi\" (commonly called “pounds”) in  \"bar\" or in “Kpa”.  That’s why in your car’s chart you can find any of them. Take  the machine that you will use for the measurements and <strong>check which unit it uses  and ​consider only that data in the tag​.</strong> The other data  will be the equivalent in other  units, so you don’t need to use it.</p><h2>When shall I check the pressure of the tires of my 595? </h2><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">⚠   <strong>We recommend you to check the pressure of the tires once every 15 days​</strong> and every time you are  about to start a long trip. You must do this measurement<strong> with ​cold tires for it to be precise. </strong>​Meaning,  don’t do it in the middle of a long journey because you will probably get a useless reading. Keep in mind that, while running, the tires get naturally deformed, by producing heat and absorbing the heat  from the road. The temperature rise makes ​the pressure to rise​ as well and then we might get higher values than we should in the measurement. </p><h2>Why is it important to respect the recommended pressure in your 595? </h2><p>The tires’ pressure was well studied by the manufacturers in order to guarantee: </p><ul><li> <strong>Security​: </strong>it improves the maneuverability and the stability and reduces the  braking. Also, it reduces the temperature of the tires, lessening the  chances of having punctures. </li><li> <strong>Fuel efficiency​: </strong>tires with the appropriate pressure generate less  resistance for the wheels and will therefore spend less fuel, contributing  both to saving money and with the environment.</li><li><strong> Reduces tire erosion: </strong>​the tires will be deformed less and will be less  mechanically demanded. In consequence, they will have longer life time. On top of this, the tire’s erosion will be even in the whole tire.<strong>Comfort​</strong>: you will feel that your car is more stable and will feel less the  potential irregularities of the road (because you will have better shock  absorbency). </li></ul><h2>Erosion according with the tire inflation level on a 595 </h2><p>The correct tire inflation level ensures that the tires’ footprint is optimal. More or  less pressure will provoque undesired deformations. As a consequence, <strong>there will be  an​ uneven erosion ​and ​less adherence ​than the one needed​</strong>.</p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/neumatico-desgaste.jpg\"></div><p></p><h2>Can I use a different pressure on my 595? </h2><p>You can use other pressure, but only in specific situations and knowing its possible  consequences: </p><ul><li> <strong>When you ride in sand​:</strong> lowering the pressure to 15 pounds will make  the tire’s track to widen and the tire to be in more contact with the field,  improving traction. Going back to a harder surface, you will need to  pump up the tires again for not damaging them.</li><li> <strong>To reduce fuel’s consumption:</strong> ​one can rise in 3 or 4 pounds the  pressure while circulating in a city. The other side of the coin of this tip is  that you will feel the irregularities of the road much more, you will have a worse ground attachment and you will have more erosion of the tire in its central area.  </li></ul><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠  An important recommendation: while  circulating in wet grounds​ (such as the ones you find on a rainy day), it is key to keep the adequate pressure, recommended by the manufacturer; because it will  guarantee you better adherence to the ground and therefore you will avoid accidents.  </p>",

The two of them are derived from petroleum, and they are formed by hydrocarbons (hydrogen and carbon molecules).</p><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️  <strong>The main rule is that you must only use diesel in Diesel engines and gasoline in spark-ignition engines </strong>(called “Otto cycle engines”).<strong> Otherwise, the engine of your 595 may get ruined.</strong></p><p>To obtain energy from fuel, it must be burning: in a Diesel engine, the diesel burns because of the compression, and in an Otto cycle engine, it burns by a spark created by the spark plug. For this reason, each type of fuel has different characteristics: diesel is more oily and takes longer to burn, while gasoline is more volatile and burns a lot faster.</p><p>Diesel engines are more efficient than Otto engines, but their exhaust smoke is more contaminant. For this reason, they have to go through certain processes to comply with the pollution prevention laws, and that makes them more expensive.</p><p><strong>Natural gas </strong>is the third type of fuel, and it is mainly used in Latin-American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. To use it, many modifications should be made to the fuel system of the car, and a certified company should do it. This type of fuel makes the car have less autonomy than the other ones, so the engine’s performance may not be ideal, but since it is <strong>a lot cheaper</strong>, it is also popular.</p><p>There are two other types of fuel that are massively used: <strong>biodiesel </strong>and <strong>ethanol</strong> (ethylic alcohol). They are generally used as additives, the first one for Diesel fuel and the second one for gasoline.

                        "<h2> How to improve the fuel consumption of your 595</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In a few words:</strong><br>Fuel is the only <strong>source of energy</strong> that powers your 595, and consequently <strong>all the elements </strong>you might need <strong>that consume</strong> energy such as lights, music and air conditioning <strong>will impact</strong> directly on the amount of fuel used. If you decrease their usage you will see improved fuel economy. Another way of optimizing fuel consumption is by using the recommended type of fuel for your 595.</p><p><strong> </strong>To know the recommended fuel for your 595 you can check the <a href=\"/abarth/595/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>. <strong></strong></p><p><strong>It is important to use the recommended fuel so that the fuel consumption of your 595 is optimal.</strong></p><h2>Common factors that affect the normal fuel consumption on a 595:</h2><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Driving manner: drive in a stable manner.</strong> Aggressive acceleration and braking will drastically increase fuel consumption since they require more engine power.</li><li><strong>If the car has a manual transmission, do not step on the clutch pedal as soon as you step on the brakes:</strong> cars with electronic fuel injection usually cut fuel supply when you stop stepping on the accelerator when the car is put in gear. Take advantage of the “engine braking” by letting the car stop on its own. In this way fuel consumption will decrease A LOT.</li><li><strong>Speed</strong>: the higher the speed, the greater the power needed. <strong>On highways, the optimal speed is of 60 mph with the car set in its highest gear.</strong> If we take into account the laws of physics, doubling the speed means increasing the power 8 times.</li><li><strong>Air conditioner</strong>: Always use the air conditioner in <strong>“recirculation” mode</strong>. Air conditioning consumes quite a lot of the engine's energy. Cooling the air inside the cabin is a lot easier than cooling the air coming from outside constantly. On the other hand, as the air conditioner compressor is usually mechanically connected to the engine, if there are more engine revolutions the energy consumption will increase.</li><li><strong>Tire pressure</strong>: it is important that your tires have the<strong> pressure indicated</strong> by the manufacturer, both to have minimal fuel consumption as well as for security, to preserve the tires in optimal conditions with minimal wear. To know the recommended pressure for your tires you can read our <a class=\"\" href=\"/abarth/595/guides/tire-pressure\">\n                <span class=\"\">tire pressure guide.</span>\n              </a></li><li><strong>Rolled down car windows</strong>: if the windows are rolled down the aerodynamics of the car will be reduced and aerodynamics play an important role when going at <strong>more than 45 mph</strong>, when air resistance increases considerably.</li><li> <strong>Electrical consumption</strong>: it may be caused because <strong>more lights </strong>were added or because the <strong>sound</strong> system was upgraded to a more powerful one. This consumes more of the battery's electricity, which at the same time will need more of the alternator's supply, which will eventually consume more of the engine's power.</li></ol><h2>Issues of your 595 which increase fuel consumption</h2><ul><li><strong>Tight brakes</strong>: If you feel that your car subtly brakes all the time, you should take it to a mechanic so that they can <strong>clean and adjust the brakes</strong>. If you don't do this, you will accelerate more than you want just to maintain a specific speed.</li><li><strong>Defective battery</strong>: a defective battery lowers its efficiency and makes it require more electrical power from the alternator (which, in turn, consumes more of the engine's power).</li><li><strong>Clogged up air filter</strong>: this decreases combustion efficiency and more fuel is required to achieve the same power.</li><li><strong>Damaged spark plugs and/or spark plugs' wires</strong>: the spark of the spark plugs is weaker than usual and the fuel burns in an incomplete manner, for which reason more fuel is needed to achieve the same power (or speed).</li><li><strong>Defective ignition coil</strong>: this is just like the previous item, but you should notice this problem when you drive, as the engine works in a “mismatched” manner; you can feel vibrations, your car suddenly stops or it jerks when you accelerate or drive at a constant speed.</li><li><strong>Leaks in the fuel circuit</strong>: You can identify them if you perceive a constant gasoline <strong>smell</strong>.</li><li><strong>Dirty or damaged injectors</strong>: they may lead to the leak of small quantities of fuel when it is not necessary, even with the engine stopped. This may also damage the exhaust system of the engine as the waste is accumulated.</li><li><strong>Dirty or damaged fuel filter</strong>: it allows the filth to go through, which damages the injectors.</li><li><strong>Faulty oxygen sensor (Lambda probe)</strong>: it indicates incorrect oxygen values which makes the air and the fuel mix inadequately and this increases fuel consumption.</li><li> <strong>Faulty mass air flow sensor</strong>: this electronic management system has no way of knowing clearly how much air is actually going inside the engine, and for this reason this mixture becomes inefficient, as well as the combustion.</li></ul><p>You can check fuel consumption by paying attention to the <strong><em>instantaneous consumption</em></strong> and the <strong><em>average consumption</em></strong>, which can be verified in cars with an on-board computer. The first one will give you a reference to evaluate in which cases your car consumes the lowest amount of fuel so as to repeat these scenarios, and the second one will give you a value to compare with the values of other users to check if your car’s fuel consumption is average or if your car has <strong>any of the problems mentioned</strong> in the previous section.</p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\"> <strong>✔️</strong> <strong>Recommendations if you want to buy a car with good fuel economy:</strong><br><br><strong>1 - </strong>Choose small cars with small engines.<br><strong>2 - </strong>It is important that these cars do not have a “square” shape, their body should be more aerodynamic.<br><strong>3 - </strong>Look up information about fuel consumption declared by their manufacturers and other users so that you can compare them.</p>",

The most common ones can be found inside of the space designed for both the driver and the passengers, but there are also external airbags to protect any passersby, although not all cars have them. You can read the <a href=\"/abarth/595/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> to know more about your car’s airbags.</p><p><strong>Internal airbags:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Front driver airbag: </strong>it protects the thorax and the head of the driver if there is a frontal collision. It is located in the middle of the steering wheel, and it is the most common one.</li><li><strong>Front passenger airbag: </strong>it is like the airbag for driver, but located inside of the glove box.</li><li><strong>Knee airbags: </strong>they protect the driver and the passenger from any leg and calf injuries. They are placed under the steering wheel and the glove box.</li><li><strong>Side airbags: </strong>they protect the passengers in case of side collisions by preventing their bodies from crashing into the car. They may be inside of the seats or inside of the bodywork.</li><li><strong>Curtain airbags: </strong>they protect the passengers in case of side collisions. They are mounted in the roof above the side doors and, when they activate, they cover the internal side of the cabin, both the front and the back seats. They diminish the collision with the bodywork and protect passengers from getting hurt by broken window glass.</li><li><strong>Rear airbags:</strong> They protect the heads of rear passengers. You can usually find them in compact cars. They cover the rear window in case of a collision.</li></ul><p><strong>External airbags:</strong></p><p>These airbags activate outside of the bodywork.

This system works thanks to certain sensors placed strategically in the bodywork of the car and they are controlled by certain electronic modules. If there is a collision, the car will determine how strong it is and which airbags should be deployed.</p><p>As this system is usually very complex, if you notice any anomaly or if you see a warning light indicating that something is damaged, you should take your car to a specialist as soon as you can. Since these airbags are so important for both your and the other passengers’ safety, you should always have an expert deal with them.</p><h2>When do the airbags get activated in your 595?</h2><p>When the <strong>car sensors</strong> sense a collision, they send a signal to the car’s <strong>computer</strong>. If the computer decides that the collision is strong enough, it deploys the airbags to protect the people in the car.</p><p>Moments after they have been deployed, the airbags begin to deflate to cushion the collision of the body. This whole cycle happens at a great speed in hundredths of a second.</p><p>Once the airbags have been deployed, they are no longer useful; a specialist should replace them with new ones.</p><h2><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/airbags_externos.jpg\"></div></h2>"

Almost all of them work in the same way: the fluid goes through one or more sheets of porous paper in which these impurities are caught.</p><p><strong>⚠️ There is one main problem with filters:</strong></p><p>As time goes on, particles are accumulated in the filters and <strong>overload</strong> them, so the fluids (either fuel, air, or oil) cannot flow through them anymore. When this happens, we say that <strong>the filter is “clogged.”</strong></p><h2>When should you change the filters of your 695?</h2><ul><li><strong>Air filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> They must usually be replaced every <strong>7,000 miles.</strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_aire_admision.jpg\"></div>Purpose: they purify the air that gets into the cylinders. It catches any impurities that may be in the air, such as dirt, sand, plant remains, bugs, etc. It is essential to keep the internal surfaces of both cylinders and piston rings clean, which also diminishes their wear.

It prevents the injectors, as well as some other parts of the fuel feed system, from getting dirty. In Diesel cars, they also catch the water that may be in the fuel.This filter is usually close to the fuel tank in gasoline cars, and you can access it right under it. On the other hand, in Diesel cars, this filter is placed inside the engine compartment.</li><li><strong>Motor oil filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> They must usually be replaced <strong>every 5,000 - 10,000 miles (when you change the oil).</strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_aceite.jpg\"></div>Purpose: one of the purposes of the motor oil is to clean the engine and prevent dirt from sticking into metallic surfaces. The dirt transported by the oil is caught in the filter to prevent it from flowing into the engine. It also catches any metallic pieces that come from the engine wear. It is essential to keep the wear of all the internal parts of the engine to a minimum. It is attached to the engine block (monobloc), in front or next to the engine.</li><li><strong>Transmission fluid filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> Replace it or at least clean it every time you change the transmission fluid.

                        "<h2>How to change the power steering fluid of your 695?</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In short:</strong><br>Changing the power steering fluid is easy. To do so, you must make sure that your <strong>car is cold and its engine is off</strong>.<br>Take into account that you should <strong>replace it</strong> <strong>only if there is a problem with the power steering system:</strong> for example, if it is making weird noises or it is hard to turn your car’s wheels. As time goes on, this fluid gets <strong>deteriorated</strong>. You will be able to notice this deterioration because it will be <strong>dark and dull</strong>. If everything is working properly but its level is low, refill it until it reaches the mark; you don’t need to replace it completely.</p><p>To replace it, you will need these <strong>elements</strong>:</p><ul><li>The recommended power steering fluid for your car.

Lift both front wheels with the jack, so that there are a few centimeters between them and the floor. This step is not mandatory, but it makes this process easier.</p><p>2. Remove the power steering fluid reservoir and use a syringe to take most of the old fluid out.</p><p>3. Then, you need to extract the rest of the fluid that sill remains there. The reservoir has two hoses: The low pressure or return hose, and the high pressure hose. Unplug the return hose (it is usually the thinner one or the one that is plugged sideways), and then place its end in the container. The old fluid will come out of there.</p><p class=\"ArticleWarning\"><strong><em>Warning!</em></strong> Usually, these hoses do not have any marks so you will not be able to differentiate the return hose from the high pressure hose. If you disconnect the wrong hose, when you turn the wheel, the unplugged hose will suck fluid instead of discharging it. If this happens, disconnect the other hose.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/9cfa7901_Aceite de dir EN.png\"></div><p></p><p>4.

                        "<h2>What is the oxygen sensor (or lambda sensor) of your 695?</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In short:<br></strong>The oxygen sensor, also known as the <strong>lambda sensor</strong>, is in the exhaust system and <strong>measures the oxygen level in the exhaust gases</strong>. This information is later used by the central computer of your 695 (ECU or PCM) to control the fuel injection and allow the engine to work efficiently without wasting fuel or reducing its efficiency.</p><p>The exhaust system may have 1 or 2 oxygen sensors. The main one is in the inlet of the catalytic converter, and it monitors the gases that come out of the engine. The second one (if your car has one) is in the catalytic converter outlet, and its purpose is to monitor its performance. It is important to remember that if the catalytic converter malfunctions, extremely pollutant gases will be released into the atmosphere. The oxygen sensor usually begins to fail after the car has driven from <strong>55,000 to 90,000 miles (90,000 to 140,000 km), </strong>and that is when you should replace it. If it is working correctly, you do not have to replace it. Take into account that this is not an essential component with set maintenance periods, even if it helps your 695 work efficiently by reducing its emissions, and it also helps extend the engine lifespan. <strong>The oxygen sensor usually malfunctions when a lot of dirt has been accumulated </strong>due to the wrong fuel type or low-quality fuel usage. <strong>Most of the time </strong>you just need to clean it for it to go back to normal.</p><h2>Signs that show that your 695‘s oxygen sensor is faulty</h2><p>You will usually notice that the oxygen sensor is faulty when the <strong>idle speed is unstable</strong>, there is increased fuel consumption, and the <strong>check engine light</strong> comes on (you can see this light below). </p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/testigo_check_engine.png\"></div><p></p>",
                        "<h2>What is the MAP sensor of your 695?</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In short:</strong><br><strong>The MAP sensor is the sensor that measures the pressure of the intake manifold, also called inlet manifold, of the engine</strong> (the part where the air comes in). <strong>If it gets damaged, you should replace it</strong>, because it cannot be fixed. <br>The acronym MAP stands for Manifold Absolute Pressure.</p><p>The MAP sensor is next to the butterfly valve, and it is usually attached to its structure or to the intake manifold. This sensor is small, and its parts are immovable. It has a small hose that is placed in a hole that leads to the inside of the air circuit.</p><p>To function, the engine always tries to draw air in, but the butterfly valve blocks it partially. This creates a depression (a “negative” pressure) inside the intake manifold. It is like sucking the air in an empty plastic bottle. The faster the engine spins, and/or, the tighter this butterfly valve is closed, the bigger this depression will get. With this and some other pieces of information, the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) estimates the engine load (the burden placed on the engine) and adjusts the fuel injection to keep its optimal performance and minimize its fuel consumption.</p><h2>Signs that show that your 695‘s MAP sensor is faulty</h2><ul><li>The <em>Check engine</em> light comes on</li><li>Erratic speed: sometimes you cannot speed up, the acceleration may be slow, or your car may decelerate</li><li>Increased smoke emissions</li></ul><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️ <strong>Some other problems may cause symptoms similar to those of a faulty MAP sensor</strong>, for example, vacuum leaks. For this reason, it is important to examine the vacuum circuit breaker before you change this sensor.<br>⚠️<strong>If the MAP sensor gets damaged, you need to replace it </strong>because it cannot be fixed.</p>",

Some vehicles also include a similar sensor in the accelerator pedal called “APP sensor”.<br>The TPS sensor is located in the throttle body. If your vehicle has an automatic transmission, the TPS sensor also influences the control of the gears.</p><h2>Signs that show that your 695‘s TPS is faulty</h2><ul><li>Unstable idle speed</li><li>Lack of power</li><li>The car stalls or jerks</li><li>The “check engine” light comes on</li><li>In automatic cars, the gears may not work properly</li></ul>",

                        "<h2>What should you do if the engine of your 695 overheats?</h2><p><strong>If the warning light of your 695 comes on</strong>, or you see that there is steam coming out of the car’s hood (or bonnet), you should follow these precautions for both your safety and your car’s safety:</p><p><strong>If the temperature is high but there is NO steam coming out of the hood:</strong></p><ul><li>Stop your car in a safe place and do not turn your car off so that the refrigeration system keeps on working.</li><li>Wait with your engine at idle speed until its temperature drops and the light goes out. Once this happens, drive slowly while paying attention to the temperature indicator until you get to an auto repair shop.</li><li>If the temperature does not drop, turn the engine off and phone your preferred tow truck.</li></ul><p class=\"ArticleWarning\"><strong>If there is steam coming out of the hood:</strong><br><br><strong>⚠️ Turn your car off and get away from it.</strong> Do not try to open its hood, this steam flows at high temperatures and it may be dangerous to stay close to it. <strong>Let it cool down on its own.</strong><br><br>⚠️ Call your insurance company so that a tow truck can come for your car.<br><br>⚠️ After such an incident, it is probable that your <strong>engine has been damaged</strong> and will not work anymore. You should have a specialist check it out if that is the case.<br><br><strong>⚠️ Under no circumstances should you open the hood or the coolant reservoir. If you do that, the liquid may be ejected upwards, and you may get burned.</strong></p><h2>What kind of coolant should you use in your 695?</h2><p><strong></strong> There are a lot of different types and brands of coolants, and each one has its particular characteristics. You should always use the kind of coolant indicated in the  <a href=\"/abarth/695/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>. Like this, your  695‘s engine will be thoroughly protected. If there is an emergency, you can use a coolant with glycol, no matter their color (they may be either green or pink). Afterward, when you have time, you can check the specific type of coolant your car needs.<strong></strong></p><h2><strong></strong><p></p></h2><h2>How do I prevent my 695 from overheating?</h2><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">There are some overheating causes that you can easily prevent yourself:<br><br><strong>-  Always use high-quality coolants:</strong> change the coolant every 30,000 miles (50,000 kilometers) or after 2 years. If you want to know more about this, you should read the  <a href=\"/abarth/695/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.<br><br><strong>- Never use water </strong>(either distilled or tap water): the coolant has certain qualities that are very important for the correct performance of the system. For example, it boils at a higher temperature.<br><br><strong>- Check the coolant level every 15 days: </strong>keep the coolant level up to the level indicated in the coolant reservoir.<br><br><strong>- Clean the radiator fins: </strong>the radiator may gather some garbage such as leaves, mud, or dust that clogs its airflow and its cooling qualities will decrease. Clean it with a brush every time you check the coolant level.</p><h2>Why does my 695‘s engine overheat?</h2><p>There are two main causes for engine overheat:</p><ol type=\"1\"><li>The coolant does not flow through the system like it should</li><li>There is not enough air flowing through the radiator</li></ol><p><em>⚠️ The coolant does not flow through the system like it should. These may be some of the causes:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Not enough coolant: </strong>check the coolant level periodically. If the level is under the minimum level recommended, the engine may overheat because there is not enough coolant.</li><li><strong>The pump may be worn out:</strong> it is advisable to change the pump every time you change the timing belt, since there is an excellent cost-benefit relationship.</li><li><strong>Clogged radiator: </strong>the internal tubes are small and, as time goes on, if the coolant is not refilled periodically, dirt accumulates and blocks these ducts.</li><li><strong>Clogged engine ducts:</strong> just like the previous item, but in the internal engine ducts.</li><li><strong>Thermostat not opening: </strong>thermostats usually become unresponsive because of the dirt or internal damage, which prevents the coolant from circulating through the radiator and cooling down.</li></ul><p><em>⚠️ There is not enough air flowing through the radiator. These may be some of the reasons:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Clogged radiator fins: </strong>the radiator may gather some garbage such as leaves, mud, or dust that clogs its air flow and its cooling qualities will decrease.</li><li><strong>Bent radiator fins: </strong>if you are not careful, you do not handle them carefully, or pressure-wash them, the fins will get bet until they block most of the airflow.</li><li><strong>The electric fan does not work:</strong> the electric fan might be damaged. If the temperature sensor or the control module are damaged, it may also stop working.</li></ul><p><em>⚠️ Other causes:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Poor-quality coolant:</strong> you should always use the coolant recommended in the owner’s manual, and renew it after the specified time period, which is usually every 5 years.</li><li><strong>Broken or loose radiator or reservoir cap: </strong>the cooling circuit must work while it is under pressure. If the caps are damaged or loose, this pressure and the liquid will leak.</li><li><strong>Not enough lubricant:</strong> when the friction between the internal pieces increase, the temperature and the wear increase significantly, and this may cause severe damages if it is not fixed on time.</li><li><strong>The cylinder heads may be broken: </strong>the combustion gases get into the refrigeration system, and this will increase the temperature and form gas bubbles.</li></ul><h2>How does the system that cools the engine of your 695 work?</h2><p>All engines have a cooling system, which works by taking the heat from the engine to the radiator.</p><p>This system is quite simple, and it includes the following parts:</p><ul><li>Coolant</li><li>Radiator</li><li>Coolant pump</li><li>Temperature sensor</li><li>Thermostat</li><li>Electric fan</li></ul><p>The engine cools thanks to the <strong>coolant</strong>, or “antifreeze.” You can usually buy it at gas stations when you “check the fluids.” It is typically green or pink. <strong>You must never use just water; this will damage the engine in a very short time period.</strong></p><p>You can see how this system works in the following image: the liquid takes the heat generated by the engine and takes it to the <strong>radiator</strong>. There is a <strong>pump </strong>that makes the liquid flow, and it pushes it along the circuit. The hot liquid enters through the upper part of the radiator, and it comes out being cool from the bottom part.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/bbb1b168_Sin título1.png\"></div><p></p><p>In order to keep its good performance, the engine of your 695 must always stay within the optimal temperature range, which is usually around 190ºF (90°C). To guarantee this temperature, the system has two “auxiliary” pieces that control temperatures: the thermostat and the electric fan. The <strong>thermostat </strong>prevents the coolant from cooling too much, and the <strong>electric fan</strong> stops it from heating.</p><p>The<strong> temperature sensor</strong> monitors the whole system that is usually controlled by the central computer or by a separate electronic module, depending on the car manufacturer.</p><p>Like in every system, any of these parts may malfunction or get damaged, and that will make the engine overheat, as we explained above.</p>",

Moreover, if the car has a diesel engine, this system will also block the “stop” relay, which will prevent the fuel from being injected into the engine. Sometimes, this system will also block the steering column which will lock the steering wheel.</p><h2>Why is the immobilizer activated on a 695?</h2><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">The main reason is because the car's computer does not recognize or does not detect the signal sent by the chip which is inside the key. The most common reasons as to why this happens are:<br><br>⚠️ <strong>Low battery of the key or the remote control:</strong> the chip will not send the signal.<br><br>⚠️<strong> The chip of the key is damaged or has been decoded</strong>: it may happen if the key is damaged or if it gets wet.<br><br>⚠️ <strong>Faulty electrical wiring:</strong> it may happen both in the antenna as well as in the immobilizer unit or the engine's computer.</p><p>Less frequent causes:</p><ul><li><strong>Damaged antenna</strong>: due to electrical reasons, the antenna may stop working.</li><li><strong>Lack of synchronization of the immobilizer unit.</strong></li><li><strong>Electronic failure</strong>: any of the contacts or internal electronic components of the module or the computer may get damaged.</li></ul><h2>How can I fix an immobilizer problem on a 695?</h2><p>Since this system is delicate, it is advisable to leave this process in the hands of a specialist.</p><p>First, the technician will <strong>scan the car</strong> with the adequate diagnosis equipment to check if the problem is actually related to the immobilizer system.</p><p>If that is the case, the technician will have to identify the cause among the causes already mentioned and then see if this problem can be solved via programming or if it is necessary to replace any of the components.</p><h2>How does the immobilizer or anti-theft system or your 695 work?</h2><p>Each <strong>original key</strong> has a chip inside which sends a signal when it gets close to the ignition switch.

It is commonly said that the oil is \"heavier\" when it is more viscous and \"lighter\" in the opposite case. Viscosity grades are measured based on SAE standards. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p>We advise you to look for the recommended viscosity in your <a href=\"/abarth/695/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> or ask your trusted mechanic. If you can’t find the information and you have to change the engine oil, this is what you have to know: </p><p>When engines work at low temperatures (engine start), the oil should be more fluid in order to reach every part of the engine and ensure immediate lubrication. After a few minutes, the temperature of the engine will rise and, ideally, the oil viscosity should be higher. This ensures proper lubrication without breaking the lubricant film. Nowadays, all oils meet this requirement and they are called <strong>multigrade oils </strong>(lower viscosity at cold temperatures and higher viscosity at hot temperatures).</p><p><strong>A medium viscosity level would be the SAE 10W-40 engine oil</strong>, which meet the needs of the current car models without difficulty.</p><p>If you live in a place where the temperature drops to 14° F (-10° C) or less you should use an oil with lower viscosity (5W-40 for example).<strong></strong></p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\"> ⚠️ If your vehicle has over 124,000 mi and consumes oil or you see some white smoke coming from the exhaust pipe, you can use an oil with a slightly higher viscosity to compensate for wear. </p><h2>Which engine oil should your 695 use?</h2><p><strong></strong>You can find the specific engine oil quality for your 695 in <strong>the Maintenance section </strong>of your <a href=\"/abarth/695/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.

The type will change according to the number of boxes their design has:</p><ul><li><strong>One-box design, monospace or monovolume: </strong>the car body does not have any divisions; it has a one-box design. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/55a7faf1_Monovolumen.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Two-box design: </strong>they have two volumes. There is one volume for the engine and the front wheel assembly, and another volume for the cabin and the trunk. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/a7788a41_2 bloques final.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Three-box design:</strong> They have three separate boxes: the front box (engine), the passenger box (cabin) and rear box (cargo).  <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/e96f4d79_3 bloques.jpg\"></div></li></ul><h2>Types according to their style</h2><p>Besides their body configuration, there is a classification according to the <strong>style </strong>of the car. In this list, the number of doors and the way the trunk is opened, among other characteristics, will be included. In this group, the different car styles will be <strong>grouped esthetically</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Sedan: </strong>it has a three-box design with four doors. It is the most common car, and you can see it has a front section (hood), a middle section (cabin), and a rear section (trunk). <strong>It has a horizontal trunk lid that does not include the glass of the rear window.</strong><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/c46c58ee_SEDAN FINAL.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Berlina: </strong>it is very similar to sedan cars, but <strong>the trunk lid does include the glass of the rear window</strong>. This means that you can enter the cabin through the trunk. That is why this design is said to have five doors. Esthetically speaking, if we compare them to sedan cars, the trunk seems smaller in comparison to the cabin.  <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/6e2e8048_berlina.png\"></div></li><li><strong>Station wagon: </strong>they have a two-box design where the <strong>cabin </strong>and the <strong>trunk share a volume</strong>. According to their manufacturing country, they are also be called “Break” or “Avant,” among others.  <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/3b04d38c_Familiar.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Three or five doors: </strong>their car bodies have two boxes. <strong>The trunk lid includes the rear window when it opens, </strong>so its opening is wide. For this reason, it is considered another door, and it is added to the number of side doors. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/80f31e69_3 puertas.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Coupé: </strong>they have two or three boxes and only two side doors. They are called fastback or notchback (respectively) according to the angle that the rear window forms with the trunk door (we will explain this later).   <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/e7bdf60a_coupe.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Convertible: </strong>also called Cabriolet or Roadster. The roof can be retraced or removed. You can keep it in the trunk and the cabin will be roofless. This way, you will be able to enjoy the sun and the wind.  <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/1d0fa30b_descapotable.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>SUV (sport utility vehicle): </strong>they usually have two boxes, but they are bigger than a regular car’s. They were designed to be road-going passenger cars, but they can also move off-road occasionally thanks to their bigger wheels. There are more sophisticated versions that are also 4x4.  <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/552ec347_SUV-deportivo utilitario final.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Crossover: </strong>they are a crossover between sedan and SUV cars. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/bb496efc_crossover.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Pick-up or trucks: </strong>they have a cargo area at the back that is usually open, although they may include a tarpaulin cover or a rigid one made of plastic.  <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/55340c44_pickup.png\"></div></li><li><strong>Off-road cars: </strong>they usually have two boxes, and their main purpose is to drive through off-road complications (mud, sand, snow, or rocks). They typically have four-wheel drive and wheels that are big and have noticeable patterns for better grip. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/c3c8b69c_todo terreno.png\"></div></li></ul><h2>Types according to the rear section</h2><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/ef6054de_maleteros 2.jpg\"></div><p></p><p><strong>1. Notchback: </strong>it is a synonym for three-box cars. The front section, middle section, and rear section are well-defined.</p><p><strong>2. Hatchback: </strong>they are two-box cars. The rear truck lid includes the rear window glass, and its shape falls abruptly, which makes the rear part of the car have a pronounced shape. Through its truck, you can enter the cabin. Unlike station wagons, hatchback cars have a shorter overhang rear and a truck door that is less vertical.</p><p><strong>3. Liftback: </strong>they are a variation of hatchback cars, but their truck door is sloping. They usually have four side doors, so they are considered equivalent to “five door” cars.</p><p><strong>4. Fastback or Sportback: </strong>there is a single slope from the roof to the tail. They are aerodynamic cars.</p>",
                        "<h2>What is the IAC valve of your 695?</h2><p>The IAC valve (Idle Air Control valve) is designed to keep a steady idle speed. The idle speed, also known simply as “idle,” is the amount of revolutions that the engine keeps when our foot is not pressing the accelerator. The IAC valve is controlled by the computer and it balances any burden upon the engine, like the usage of the air conditioner, the lights or the sound system. When the engine is cold, it helps it start by keeping the revolutions somewhat higher until the engine heats up.</p><h2>Symptoms that show that your 695‘s IAC valve is failing</h2><ul><li>The engine stalls when the car is idling (idle speed)</li><li>It is hard to start the vehicle when the engine is cold</li><li>Unstable revolutions that go up and down</li><li>The engine stalls if the air conditioner is turned on</li><li>The “check engine” light comes on</li></ul><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️ You should check the IAC valve periodically to make sure it is clean, since it usually malfunctions because of the accumulation of carbon residue which is produced by the combustion of the engine.</p>",
                        "<h2>Booster seats for children in your 695: all you need to know</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In short:</strong><br>- Children <strong>must always sit in the back seat of the car and use an adequate booster seat</strong>.<br>- The booster seat must be <strong>anchored to the seat</strong> of your<strong> 695 the way their manufacturer recommends.</strong><br>- Once the booster seat is installed and anchored, you <strong>can check it</strong> by moving it firmly in many directions. It should not move more than 1 inch (2.5cm).<br>- The booster seat should be <strong>facing the rear until the child is four years old.</strong><br>- Make sure to <strong>check the anchor of the seat periodically</strong>. Research has shown that <strong>3 out of 5 booster seats are not fixed properly</strong>.</p><h2>How should children travel in your 695?</h2><p>Children should always be <strong>restrained by booster seats; </strong>they must never roam freely inside the car or sit in your lap. This should be the case <strong>until they are at least 51 inches tall</strong> (1.4 meters). This system is generically known as child restraint system.</p><p>In most countries, the law states that children should be facing the rear up until they are one year old, but specialists have stated that they should sit that way <strong>until they are four years old</strong> because that is when their cervical muscles can endure a frontal collision without getting badly injured.</p><p>Children may stop using booster seats when:</p><ul><li>They can <strong>bend their knees</strong> naturally while sitting down with their hip touching the back of the seat.</li><li><strong>The chest safety belt</strong> is on <strong>their shoulders,</strong> and not their necks.</li><li><strong>The abdominal safety belt </strong>is on their hip, between their legs and abdomen.</li></ul><p>Although many countries regulate this depending on the child’s age, and not their size, <strong>you should always consider your children’s weight and height</strong>, not their age.</p><h2>Can you use any kind of booster seat in your 695?</h2><p><strong>NO.</strong> Booster seats for children <strong>are classified</strong> into different groups according to the <strong>child’s size and weight</strong>. They also include different <strong>anchors</strong> for the seat: the <strong>traditional </strong>system (with a safety belt), <strong>ISOFIX,</strong> or <strong>LATCH</strong>. You should choose the right one both for your children and your car. If you want to know which one to use, you should read the <a href=\"/abarth/695/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> of your 695. Take into account that different brands may have different ways to anchor the seats, but they should always be <strong>certified according to the regulations</strong> we will now mention.</p><h2>Booster seat sizes</h2><p>Booster seats can be categorized according to the 3 main safety regulations: the <strong>FMVSS 213</strong> (American) and european <strong>ECE R44</strong> and <strong>UN R129</strong> (a.k.a. <strong>i-Size</strong>, newer and more complete). R44 categorizes according to the weight of the child, i-Size is based on height and the american FMV is a mix between both.</p><p class=\"ArticleWarning\"><strong>The American regulation has three groups:</strong><br><br><strong>Infant:</strong> for children whose size is up to 32 inches (or 0.8 meters) and their weight between 4 and 35 pounds (or 2 to 16 kilograms). These seats are meant to face the rear.<br><br><strong>Convertible: </strong>for children whose size is between 19 and 45 inches (or 0.5 and 1.2 meters). They are meant for children who are between 5 and 40 pounds (or 2 to 18 kilograms), and you should place them facing the rear, unless the child’s weight is between 20 and 65 pounds (or between 9 and 30 kilograms), since they can already face forward at that point.<br><br><strong>Booster</strong>: Up to 65 inches (or 1.65 meters) and 120 pounds (55 kilograms). They face forward and are used with a seat belt.</p><p>⚠️Regarding the European regulations, <strong>the only current products are ECE R44/03 and R44/04.</strong> R44/01 and R44/02 are not supported anymore, so we advise against using them.</p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\"><strong>The European regulation makes a distinction between 4 groups according to the child’s weight:</strong><br><br><strong>Group 0:</strong> up to 10 kilograms<br><strong>Group 0+:</strong> up to 13 kilograms<br><strong>Group 1: </strong>between 9 and 18 kilograms<br><strong>Group 2: </strong>between 15 and 25 kilograms - a safety belt is used to fix it to its place.<br><strong>Group 3 (booster type): </strong>between 22 and 36 kilograms - a safety belt is used to fix it to its place.</p><p>All of these booster seats have a tag with their specifications, which makes it easier to choose the right one. You can see what the information in those tags means by reading the references in this image for bothe specs, R44/04 and i-Size: </p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/60da5961_etiqueta-seguridad-universal.jpg\"></div><p></p><ol type=\"1\"><li><em>States the regulation</em></li><li><em>States the type of car you can use it in.

You can use the former in any car because they can be anchored with a seatbelt. Semi-universal seats are called  <strong>LATCH</strong> seats (according to the American regulations) and <strong>ISOFIX</strong> (according to the European regulations). They both use anchors specifically designed, which are located in the car seats. Two of these anchors are placed in the seat base, and the other one is on top, called top tether.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/adeff0ae_Capture.PNG\"></div><p></p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/a805de99_Capture2.JPG\"></div><p></p><p>ISOFIX and LATCH are very similar. The main difference is that the former has rigid anchors, while the latter uses adjustable straps. <strong>Both reduce the probability of your children suffering severe injuries in a crash by 22%.</strong> None of these systems are approved to use with a seat heavier than 18 kilograms. That is to say, they are special anchors for groups 0, 0+, and 1.</p><p>Even if the <strong>biggest booster seats (group 2 and 3 or Boosters)</strong> may include ISOFIX or LATCH anchors, they will work as secondary anchors since <strong>the main anchor for them is the safety belt</strong>.</p><p>You should read the  <a href=\"/abarth/695/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> of your 695 to see if has certified anchors and what type they are.</p>",
                        "<h2> Exhaust smoke and its colors on a 695: causes and severity</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In a few words:</strong><br>According to the color of the exhaust smoke that is released from the exhaust pipe of your 695 you will be able to identify the possible causes. The colors of the exhaust smoke that your 695 may produce will help you find the problem. In <strong>order of priority </strong>from the least to the most dangerous, these colors are:<strong> white, blue, black, mix of two colors</strong>.</p><p>First, it should be said that the exhaust gas that is usually released through the exhaust pipe of your car is basically <strong>invisible</strong>. You should see a faint and short-lived exhaust that fades shortly after appearing only if you speed up abruptly. If your 695 discharges visible exhaust smoke then it is very likely that you need to take it to a specialist.</p><h2>White exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a 695</h2><p>The exhaust gas that comes out without strength and elevates considerably (it may get over the roof) but then fades without any trace when your car is idling may only be <strong>water vapor.</strong> This exhaust does not smell like anything in particular and it can be seen if the temperature is low or if there is humidity. <strong>If this is the case, do not worry.</strong></p><p><strong>If the white exhaust smoke does not fade, it is dense and smells, then</strong> it is associated with a <strong>coolant leak</strong>. In this case, the <strong>coolant level</strong> of your 695 <strong>should be low</strong>. Have your car checked up by a specialist to confirm this leak and prevent your engine from overheating.</p><p>⚠️<strong> Check the recovery tank. </strong>If you see that the <strong>coolant is bubbling</strong> that means that it is leaking into the combustion chamber. This is caused by a leak of exhaust gases into the cooling system. If your car has these symptoms <strong>you should</strong> <strong>have your engine checked</strong> by a specialist at once since this malfunction may bring serious problems.</p><p>This liquid leak may be caused by the following reasons:</p><ul><li>The cylinder head gasket is damaged (which is the cheapest problem to fix)</li><li>The cylinder head or the engine block are cracked (which is more expensive)</li></ul><h2>Blue exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a 695</h2><p>At first sight this exhaust smoke seems white but it has a <strong>blueish tone, a certain density and a particular smell, like something is burning. </strong>Moreover, its <strong>volume increases significantly when you step on the accelerator.</strong></p><p>This blue exhaust smoke indicates that the <strong>lubricant oil is burning</strong>, either because there is a leak into the inside of the combustion chamber or a leak into the exhaust system.</p><p>⚠️ <strong>Check if the level of lubricant oil</strong> of your 695 <strong>is decreasing drastically</strong> to verify if that is the cause.</p><p>The causes for this lubricant leak are usually the following:</p><ul><li><strong>The valve stem seals are in a bad shape</strong></li><li>The <strong>piston rings are worn down</strong></li><li>Leaks of oil in the supercharger (if the engine of you 695 has this system)</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, fixing any of these problems is expensive and they usually affect<strong> high mileage engines</strong> (with more than 90,000 miles) or cars with <strong>badly battered engines</strong>.</p><p><strong>If the exhaust smoke is blue but it is not too dense</strong>, it may be caused by a blockage in the crankcase ventilation system.</p><p>⚠️ In this case, <strong>the exhaust smoke will come from the engine and not from the exhaust pipe</strong>.</p><p>It is normal to see blueish exhaust coming from the exhaust pipe of mopeds and motorbikes with a two-stroke engine, and, in those cases, this exhaust is not caused by a failure.</p><h2>Black exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a 695</h2><p>This problem <strong>is usually seen in diesel engines</strong> and it is caused by a <strong>great increase in the amount of fuel supplied to the engine</strong>, that is to say, the engine is burning more fuel than it should.</p><p>⚠️ Check if the <strong>consumption of fuel</strong> of your 695 <strong>has increased significantly</strong>.<strong> You should also notice</strong> this because of <strong>the reduction of power </strong>of the engine.</p><p>You can also verify this flaw by <strong>putting a white cloth inside the exhaust pipe, clogging it up for a few seconds</strong>. This cloth will <strong>turn black</strong> instantly due to the expelled coal particles.</p><p>This black color is caused by the generation of hydrocarbons that are not completely burnt. They create more <strong>carbonaceous particles</strong> which soil the lubricant oil and they settle in each nook and cranny of the engine of your 695. At the same time, they are also accumulated inside the combustion chamber as hard crusts that are abrasive and wear down movable pieces.</p><p>The exhaust system is also affected because of the accumulation of cinder, which also poses a threat to the catalytic converter, the particle filter or the muffler of the car.</p><p>This problem may be caused by any of the following items:</p><ul><li>The air filter is too dirty.</li><li>The fuel injectors, the fuel pressure regulator, the throttle position sensor (TPS), or the Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor are dirty or there is an electrical flaw in them.</li><li>The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve is malfunctioning (this valve recirculates the exhaust gases back to the engine). When you accelerate, this EGR valve remains open so that the exhaust gases can get inside the engine once again.</li></ul><h2>Two-colored exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a 695</h2><p>In the worst case scenario the released exhaust will be two-colored. This means that there are many simultaneous causes for this problem and it is important that a specialist investigates this as soon as possible to prevent further failures.</p>",
                        "<h2>What do the technical specifications of your 695’s engine mean?</h2><p>Even though all engines are very similar when you look at them, there are many different types. We will now show you what the most usual technical specifications that you can find in the <strong>technical datasheet</strong> of your <strong> 695 </strong>mean.</p><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Gasoline or Diesel engines</strong><br><br>This is the main difference between engines. Engines that need Diesel have incandescent spark plugs that only work when the car starts. Once the engine is running, the fuel ignites by itself since it is compressed inside the cylinders thanks to the high temperature it reaches.<br>On the other hand, gasoline engines work thanks to the spark constantly created by the spark plugs. This means that they work all the time the engine is running.<br>Another difference between these two engines is that Diesel engines are generally heavier, and their structure is more robust.</li><li><strong>Number of cylinders</strong><br><br>It is the <strong>number</strong> of cylinders inside the engine. <strong>The engine power is generated </strong>in the cylinders because that is where the pistons are. For this reason, the more cylinders the engine has, the more its power will be. This also means that the engine will be bigger and heavier. It is also important to notice that if there are a lot of cylinders, the engine will consume more fuel. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/bloque.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Bore/stroke ratio</strong><br><br><strong>These are the piston’s measurements, </strong>and they can be expressed in centimeters or inches. They indicate the cylinder diameter (bore) and the longitudinal displacement (stroke) that the piston does inside the cylinder when the engine is running. These measurements allow us to measure the “displaced volume” by the piston. <strong>If the diameter is wide and the piston has a short stroke, the engine will be fit for sports cars.</strong> In other words, the revolutions per minute (RPMs) will be high.  <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/cf9931c1_carrera y diametro.png\"></div></li><li><strong>Engine displacement</strong><br><br>It is the total available volume in the engine cylinders. It is calculated by multiplying the stroke length, the bore, and the number of cylinders.<br>Depending on the country, it may be expressed in liters (1.6 L, 2.0 L, 3.6 L), or in cubic inches (98, 110, 250, 510 CI).<br>Generally, <strong>the higher the engine displacement is, the more power your car will have, but the higher its fuel consumption will be.</strong></li><li><strong>Cylinder arrangement</strong><br><br>a) In-line arrangement: nowadays, it is hard to find engines with more than 6 in-line cylinders because they take up too much space under the hood.<br><br>b) V-type arrangement: They are more compact and create fewer vibrations, but they can only be used with an even number of cylinders (V6, V8, V10, etc.).<br><br>c) Opposed arrangement: they are flat and not frequently used because their manufacture and maintenance are very demanding. Moreover, like the V-type arrangement, they can only be used with an even number of cylinders. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/tipo_de_motor.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Valvetrain type: SOHC and DOHC</strong><br><br>a) SOHC (single overhead camshaft):  It only has one camshaft placed in the cylinder head. Only one camshaft controls all the engine’s valves. They generally have more power if there are low RPMs. The camshaft is in charge of opening and closing the engine’s valves.<br>b) DOHC (double overhead camshaft): It has two camshafts placed in the cylinder head. One camshaft controls the admission valve while the other controls the escape valve. The performance of these engines is usually better if the RPMs are high. Moreover, its parts are usually lighter and can move faster.</li><li><strong>Compression ratio</strong><br><br><strong>It is the measurement of how much the volume of the air-fuel mixture can be compressed inside of the cylinder.</strong> The higher this number is, the higher the engine power will be. For example, if there is an 8:1 ratio, this means that the mixture will be reduced to one octave of its original volume.<br>Generally, compression ratios are between 8:1 and 12:1 for gasoline engines.</li><li><strong>Naturally aspirated or turbo engines</strong><br><br>A <strong>naturally aspired</strong> engine means <strong>that the engine draws air directly through an air intake.</strong> In turbocharged cars, on the other hand,<strong> the turbocharger injects air by forcing it into the engine.</strong> The advantage of using turbochargers is that, in small engines, the power increases because it is possible to inject more air and fuel into the cylinders.</li><li><strong> Torque</strong><br><br><strong>It is the “strength” that the engine has when it accelerates.</strong><br>It is measured in “foot-pounds” or in “N.m” (1 N.m = 0.737 ft.lb), and to express it, the RPM of the engine must also be stated. For example: 150 N.m @ 1700 RPM.<br>Off-road cars usually have a lot of torque and not so much power. This enables them to drive up big slopes at a slow speed or dodge big pits and rocks. Diesel engines have more torque than gasoline engines.</li><li><strong> Power</strong><br><br><strong>It is the car’s ability to accelerate (to react) at high speeds.</strong><br>It is measured in HP (Horse Power), or in KW (1 HP = 0.745 KW).</li><li><strong> Revolutions per minute (RPM)</strong><br><br><strong>They represent the engine speed. It is important to distinguish them from the car speed since they are not the same thing.</strong> Both are related by the transmission. For example, if the car is in neutral gear and we press the accelerator, we may only change the engine speed but not the car speed.<br>Technically speaking: <em>Torque x RPM = Power</em><br>In a car, the RPM are controlled by the accelerator. Their rise depends on how much we press the accelerator, and this will be reflected in the tachometer. The higher the RPMs are, the noisier the engine will be.</li></ol>",

                        "<h2>How to keep your 695 safe during extended periods without use</h2><p>If your 695 has to stay in one place for a long time, here are some recommendations to keep your car in the best possible condition.</p><p><strong>Battery:</strong> Disconnect the negative terminal of the battery. This will prevent the electrical components from consuming it, and it will prevent any future problems when you start your 695.</p><p><strong>Tires: </strong>Inflate your car’s tires with more pressure than the recommended one for driving. Either 3 or 4 psi should be enough. Like this, they will not get deformed when they naturally deflate.</p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">If you will not use your 695 for a few months, you can also create some sort of support with bricks (or any other elements) and place it under the chassis so that it can help the wheels hold the weight of the car when the wheels deflate.</p><p><strong>Fuel:</strong> Ideally, the fuel tank should be full. If there is less air inside of the tank, there is less probability of it evaporating. Additionally, like this, if the tank is metallic, you will prevent its rusting.</p><p><strong>Hand brake:</strong> You must never activate it unless it is really necessary. It has a wire in its mechanism, and if this wire stays taut for a long period, it may get damaged. Also the brake pad (brake shoe) may get stuck or corrode the pieces it is in contact with.</p><p><strong>Fluids and oils:</strong> Check that the levels of refrigerant, steering fluid, brake fluid, and oil of your 695 are the recommended ones.</p><p><strong>Start:</strong> If you can, start your 695 once every ten days. This will prevent the wear of the mechanical pieces of the engine, and it will recharge the battery. During those moments, you should also turn the air conditioner on, move the automatic windows and turn all the lights on and off. The movement of the circuits will keep your car in good shape.</p><p><strong>Exhaust pipe: </strong>Put a small cloth with motor oil in the external part of the exhaust pipe to prevent corrosion.</p><p><strong>Cleaning: </strong>Prevent bad smells and mold in the car by cleaning the inside of the car thoroughly. You may also leave some carbon or a cup with dry rice inside so that they will absorb humidity.</p><p>To keep the outside of the car clean, you can wax your car and then cover it with a car tarpaulin.</p><p></p>",
                        "<h2>What light bulbs fit your 695?</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In short:</strong><br>If one of your 695‘s bulbs burned out and you want to know which one you should buy to replace it, you can remove it and take it to an auto part store, or you can check the maintenance section found in the <a href=\"/abarth/695/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.<br>If you replaced the bulb but it is still not working, you should check the fuses.</p><p>Your 695 has bulbs that illuminate both the outside and the inside of the car. Since headlamps are more complex, there are many types. They are the ones that illuminate the road ahead without dazzling the other drivers. Brake lights are only there to be seen at a sensible distance by the drivers behind you, and their purpose is to light up when you press the brake pedal.</p><p><strong>Generally, changing these bulbs is easy,</strong> and you can do it yourself. Cars have a different lighting system from that of a house since they are guaranteed to keep working despite the vehicle’s vibrations. You only have to make sure that their <strong>pigtail wire has been properly connected</strong>. You will know they have been connected properly because <strong>there is only one way they can be connected</strong>.</p><p>You should <strong>have a spare bulb in your 695</strong> if you are about to go on a road trip. Even if <strong>a bulb has a lifespan of several years</strong>, they are cheap and it never hurts to be careful.</p><ul><li><strong>LED lamps</strong></li></ul><p>The main advantage of LED lamps is their <strong>efficiency</strong>: they produce <strong>a lot of light,</strong> and they <strong>draw less electrical energy (</strong>up to 80% less<strong>)</strong>. Moreover, their <strong>lifespan is 25 times longer</strong> than the lifespan of a halogen lamp. LED lamps are <strong>instantly on</strong> and, since the component that produces light is relatively small, these lamps can be created in any shape or form. They are made of semiconductor materials enclosed in a small, plastic shell and only one lamp may produce different colors.</p><p>There are a lot of high-end brands that use LED technology for their products, but their usage of fixed LED light panels makes it almost impossible for them to be changed without having to visit an authorized car dealer.</p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/0af84ef3_Untitled4-628x280.png\"></div><p></p><ul><li><strong>Incandescent lamps</strong></li></ul><p>They are the <strong>oldest ones, they consume a lot of energy and create a lot of heat.</strong> They are made up of a metallic filament which is protected by a transparent glass bulb. When the electricity goes through the filament, it turns bright red and it produces light. Nowadays, these lamps are still used to illuminate <strong>car interiors, dashboard lights, brake lights, direction-indicator lights, and front position lights</strong>, since these lights do not need to be too powerful. They have different watts, sizes, and shapes according to their usage. They may have 1 or 2 filaments (just like the brake lights).</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/e7ba5170_Incandenscentes.jpg\"></div><p></p><ul><li><strong>Halogen lamps</strong></li></ul><p><strong>They are the enhanced version of incandescent lamps.</strong> <strong>The light they produce is stronger and whiter.</strong> They work the same way; the only difference is that the glass bulb encloses halogen gas, which improves the filament’s output and, therefore, also enhances its lifespan. For these reasons, these lamps are more efficient, and small halogen lamps may be powerful.</p><p>These lamps may have <strong>different</strong> amounts of filaments, their filaments may be placed in different positions, and the shape of their bulbs may be different. The most common ones are these: </p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/412a152f_Halógenas2.jpg\"></div><p></p><p><strong>H1 lamps</strong>: <strong>They are used in fog lamps and high beam lights.</strong> They only have one filament placed longitudinally and they have a compact shape. There are 55, 70 and, 100-W H1 lamps.</p><p><strong>H3 lamps</strong>: They are usually used in <strong>fog lamps and long-range lights</strong>, and they have only one filament, which is placed transversely. They are the most compact ones. They only include a small wire to connect them. There are 55, 70 and 100-W H3 lamps.</p><p><strong>H4 lamps</strong>: They are the most used in <strong>headlamps because they can also be used as dipped beam headlights and high beam lights, which saves space.</strong> They have two filaments, and they are bigger than the other types of lamps. There are usually 55/60, 70/75, and 90/100-W H4 lamps (for crossings/highways).</p><p><strong>H7 lamps</strong>: They are mainly used in <strong>fog lamps</strong>. They only have one linear filament, and they are somewhat bigger than H1 and H3 lamps.</p><ul><li><strong>Xenon lamps</strong></li></ul><p><strong>They are the brightest ones,</strong> and the light they produce is whiter than the one made by halogen lamps. Their downside is that the electrical energy needed to turn these lamps on must be high (30,000 V). Their arc needs a high current, so they need auxiliary equipment called reactance, which is in charge of controlling the electrical energy of the lamp. If you are thinking of switching to Xenon’s lamps, an auto mechanic should do it for you.</p><p><strong>These lights take one minute to reach their maximum power.</strong> The good thing is that once you turn these lights on, they <strong>consume less electricity than halogen lamps</strong>, <strong>generate less heat and their lifespan is way longer.</strong> They are <strong>more expensive</strong> than the other lamps.</p><p>Regarding their structure, they do not have filaments. They have two electrodes, separated by a few millimeters protected by a glass bulb where there is high-pressure Xenon gas. An electrical arc that produces light is created between these two electrodes. You can see this light in the following image.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/5f306ae3_xenon-lampara3.jpg\"></div><p></p>",

For sport cars (with very low profile tires), the usual thing to do  is to  inflate them to<strong> ​40 psi​. </strong><br><strong>2- ​Look up the recommendation in your  <a href=\"/abarth/695/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a></strong>.  <br><strong>3- Look up the tag in your car. </strong>​You can find it sticked in the internal frame of the  driver’s door, in the fuel-charger lid or in the sun shield. It will look like this one you  can see here:  <br></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/c2f52106_Caclo de presion generica.JPG\"></div> <br><p></p><h2>How should I interpret the chart of the tires’ pressure of my  695? </h2><p>The tag with the recommended pressures varies according to the car’s  manufacturer. Here we show you an example where you will be able to see how to  interpret its data: </p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/etiqueta_neumaticos_2.PNG\"></div> <p></p><p>A - The columns on the right show the pressure of the back tires.  </p><p>B - The columns on the left show the pressure of the front tires. </p><p>C - If we read the  rows horizontally we will see that there is a recommended  pressure according to the load that our car will carry (represented in people and  luggage).  </p><p>D - The information that appears at the bottom is the recommended pressure for  your temporary auxiliary tire, which is not the same as the one recommended for the  rest of the tires, due to its smaller size. </p><p>E - The data ​T125/60​ and  R18 which appears in this example corresponds to the  measurements of the temporary auxiliary tire.  </p><p>Depending on the country of origin of your 695, the pressure of the tires  may be measured in  \"psi\" (commonly called “pounds”) in  \"bar\" or in “Kpa”.  That’s why in your car’s chart you can find any of them. Take  the machine that you will use for the measurements and <strong>check which unit it uses  and ​consider only that data in the tag​.</strong> The other data  will be the equivalent in other  units, so you don’t need to use it.</p><h2>When shall I check the pressure of the tires of my 695? </h2><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">⚠   <strong>We recommend you to check the pressure of the tires once every 15 days​</strong> and every time you are  about to start a long trip. You must do this measurement<strong> with ​cold tires for it to be precise. </strong>​Meaning,  don’t do it in the middle of a long journey because you will probably get a useless reading. Keep in mind that, while running, the tires get naturally deformed, by producing heat and absorbing the heat  from the road. The temperature rise makes ​the pressure to rise​ as well and then we might get higher values than we should in the measurement. </p><h2>Why is it important to respect the recommended pressure in your 695? </h2><p>The tires’ pressure was well studied by the manufacturers in order to guarantee: </p><ul><li> <strong>Security​: </strong>it improves the maneuverability and the stability and reduces the  braking. Also, it reduces the temperature of the tires, lessening the  chances of having punctures. </li><li> <strong>Fuel efficiency​: </strong>tires with the appropriate pressure generate less  resistance for the wheels and will therefore spend less fuel, contributing  both to saving money and with the environment.</li><li><strong> Reduces tire erosion: </strong>​the tires will be deformed less and will be less  mechanically demanded. In consequence, they will have longer life time. On top of this, the tire’s erosion will be even in the whole tire.<strong>Comfort​</strong>: you will feel that your car is more stable and will feel less the  potential irregularities of the road (because you will have better shock  absorbency). </li></ul><h2>Erosion according with the tire inflation level on a 695 </h2><p>The correct tire inflation level ensures that the tires’ footprint is optimal. More or  less pressure will provoque undesired deformations. As a consequence, <strong>there will be  an​ uneven erosion ​and ​less adherence ​than the one needed​</strong>.</p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/neumatico-desgaste.jpg\"></div><p></p><h2>Can I use a different pressure on my 695? </h2><p>You can use other pressure, but only in specific situations and knowing its possible  consequences: </p><ul><li> <strong>When you ride in sand​:</strong> lowering the pressure to 15 pounds will make  the tire’s track to widen and the tire to be in more contact with the field,  improving traction. Going back to a harder surface, you will need to  pump up the tires again for not damaging them.</li><li> <strong>To reduce fuel’s consumption:</strong> ​one can rise in 3 or 4 pounds the  pressure while circulating in a city. The other side of the coin of this tip is  that you will feel the irregularities of the road much more, you will have a worse ground attachment and you will have more erosion of the tire in its central area.  </li></ul><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠  An important recommendation: while  circulating in wet grounds​ (such as the ones you find on a rainy day), it is key to keep the adequate pressure, recommended by the manufacturer; because it will  guarantee you better adherence to the ground and therefore you will avoid accidents.  </p>",

                        "<h2>What types of fuel exist?</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In short:<br></strong>Gasoline and diesel fuels are the main types of fuel, and they must never be mixed.</p><p>Generally speaking, car fuels are divided into two big groups: <strong>gasoline </strong>(benzene) and <strong>diesel</strong>. The two of them are derived from petroleum, and they are formed by hydrocarbons (hydrogen and carbon molecules).</p><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️  <strong>The main rule is that you must only use diesel in Diesel engines and gasoline in spark-ignition engines </strong>(called “Otto cycle engines”).<strong> Otherwise, the engine of your 695 may get ruined.</strong></p><p>To obtain energy from fuel, it must be burning: in a Diesel engine, the diesel burns because of the compression, and in an Otto cycle engine, it burns by a spark created by the spark plug. For this reason, each type of fuel has different characteristics: diesel is more oily and takes longer to burn, while gasoline is more volatile and burns a lot faster.</p><p>Diesel engines are more efficient than Otto engines, but their exhaust smoke is more contaminant. For this reason, they have to go through certain processes to comply with the pollution prevention laws, and that makes them more expensive.</p><p><strong>Natural gas </strong>is the third type of fuel, and it is mainly used in Latin-American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. To use it, many modifications should be made to the fuel system of the car, and a certified company should do it. This type of fuel makes the car have less autonomy than the other ones, so the engine’s performance may not be ideal, but since it is <strong>a lot cheaper</strong>, it is also popular.</p><p>There are two other types of fuel that are massively used: <strong>biodiesel </strong>and <strong>ethanol</strong> (ethylic alcohol). They are generally used as additives, the first one for Diesel fuel and the second one for gasoline.

                        "<h2> How to improve the fuel consumption of your 695</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In a few words:</strong><br>Fuel is the only <strong>source of energy</strong> that powers your 695, and consequently <strong>all the elements </strong>you might need <strong>that consume</strong> energy such as lights, music and air conditioning <strong>will impact</strong> directly on the amount of fuel used. If you decrease their usage you will see improved fuel economy. Another way of optimizing fuel consumption is by using the recommended type of fuel for your 695.</p><p><strong> </strong>To know the recommended fuel for your 695 you can check the <a href=\"/abarth/695/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>. <strong></strong></p><p><strong>It is important to use the recommended fuel so that the fuel consumption of your 695 is optimal.</strong></p><h2>Common factors that affect the normal fuel consumption on a 695:</h2><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Driving manner: drive in a stable manner.</strong> Aggressive acceleration and braking will drastically increase fuel consumption since they require more engine power.</li><li><strong>If the car has a manual transmission, do not step on the clutch pedal as soon as you step on the brakes:</strong> cars with electronic fuel injection usually cut fuel supply when you stop stepping on the accelerator when the car is put in gear. Take advantage of the “engine braking” by letting the car stop on its own. In this way fuel consumption will decrease A LOT.</li><li><strong>Speed</strong>: the higher the speed, the greater the power needed. <strong>On highways, the optimal speed is of 60 mph with the car set in its highest gear.</strong> If we take into account the laws of physics, doubling the speed means increasing the power 8 times.</li><li><strong>Air conditioner</strong>: Always use the air conditioner in <strong>“recirculation” mode</strong>. Air conditioning consumes quite a lot of the engine's energy. Cooling the air inside the cabin is a lot easier than cooling the air coming from outside constantly. On the other hand, as the air conditioner compressor is usually mechanically connected to the engine, if there are more engine revolutions the energy consumption will increase.</li><li><strong>Tire pressure</strong>: it is important that your tires have the<strong> pressure indicated</strong> by the manufacturer, both to have minimal fuel consumption as well as for security, to preserve the tires in optimal conditions with minimal wear. To know the recommended pressure for your tires you can read our <a class=\"\" href=\"/abarth/695/guides/tire-pressure\">\n                <span class=\"\">tire pressure guide.</span>\n              </a></li><li><strong>Rolled down car windows</strong>: if the windows are rolled down the aerodynamics of the car will be reduced and aerodynamics play an important role when going at <strong>more than 45 mph</strong>, when air resistance increases considerably.</li><li> <strong>Electrical consumption</strong>: it may be caused because <strong>more lights </strong>were added or because the <strong>sound</strong> system was upgraded to a more powerful one. This consumes more of the battery's electricity, which at the same time will need more of the alternator's supply, which will eventually consume more of the engine's power.</li></ol><h2>Issues of your 695 which increase fuel consumption</h2><ul><li><strong>Tight brakes</strong>: If you feel that your car subtly brakes all the time, you should take it to a mechanic so that they can <strong>clean and adjust the brakes</strong>. If you don't do this, you will accelerate more than you want just to maintain a specific speed.</li><li><strong>Defective battery</strong>: a defective battery lowers its efficiency and makes it require more electrical power from the alternator (which, in turn, consumes more of the engine's power).</li><li><strong>Clogged up air filter</strong>: this decreases combustion efficiency and more fuel is required to achieve the same power.</li><li><strong>Damaged spark plugs and/or spark plugs' wires</strong>: the spark of the spark plugs is weaker than usual and the fuel burns in an incomplete manner, for which reason more fuel is needed to achieve the same power (or speed).</li><li><strong>Defective ignition coil</strong>: this is just like the previous item, but you should notice this problem when you drive, as the engine works in a “mismatched” manner; you can feel vibrations, your car suddenly stops or it jerks when you accelerate or drive at a constant speed.</li><li><strong>Leaks in the fuel circuit</strong>: You can identify them if you perceive a constant gasoline <strong>smell</strong>.</li><li><strong>Dirty or damaged injectors</strong>: they may lead to the leak of small quantities of fuel when it is not necessary, even with the engine stopped. This may also damage the exhaust system of the engine as the waste is accumulated.</li><li><strong>Dirty or damaged fuel filter</strong>: it allows the filth to go through, which damages the injectors.</li><li><strong>Faulty oxygen sensor (Lambda probe)</strong>: it indicates incorrect oxygen values which makes the air and the fuel mix inadequately and this increases fuel consumption.</li><li> <strong>Faulty mass air flow sensor</strong>: this electronic management system has no way of knowing clearly how much air is actually going inside the engine, and for this reason this mixture becomes inefficient, as well as the combustion.</li></ul><p>You can check fuel consumption by paying attention to the <strong><em>instantaneous consumption</em></strong> and the <strong><em>average consumption</em></strong>, which can be verified in cars with an on-board computer. The first one will give you a reference to evaluate in which cases your car consumes the lowest amount of fuel so as to repeat these scenarios, and the second one will give you a value to compare with the values of other users to check if your car’s fuel consumption is average or if your car has <strong>any of the problems mentioned</strong> in the previous section.</p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\"> <strong>✔️</strong> <strong>Recommendations if you want to buy a car with good fuel economy:</strong><br><br><strong>1 - </strong>Choose small cars with small engines.<br><strong>2 - </strong>It is important that these cars do not have a “square” shape, their body should be more aerodynamic.<br><strong>3 - </strong>Look up information about fuel consumption declared by their manufacturers and other users so that you can compare them.</p>",

Their objective is to diminish the damages if there is a traffic collision. They complement the safety belts that you should always wear.</p><p>Airbags <strong>cushion and restrain the human body </strong>if there is a car crash. They are found in different car areas, and they are an important element for your safety: it is estimated that airbags reduce the risk of death by 30% in case of a frontal crash.</p><p>You should also know that airbags are <strong>exclusively designed to complement seat belts.</strong> That means that without seat belts, airbags are useless and extremely dangerous. The airbags are also known as <strong>SRS (Supplementary Restraint System)</strong>.</p><h2>How are the airbags of your 695 made?</h2><p>You will see in the following image that airbags are made of synthetic fabrics that are highly resistant. They are like cushions that get inflated with nitrogen if there is a collision. This happens in a matter of milliseconds since they must react during a crash.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/airbags_internos.jpg\"></div><p></p><p class=\"ArticleWarning\"><strong>What precautions should you take with the airbags of your 695?</strong><br><br>⚠️ <strong>Airbags were designed to be used along with seat belts. </strong>If an airbag is deployed while the passenger is not wearing a seat belt, they may get serious injuries on their face, head, and cervical.<br><br>⚠️ Frontal airbags placed in the passenger seat are <strong>incompatible with booster seats for children </strong>because they may produce serious injuries. You should also take into account that booster seats should always be installed in the back seats. If you want to know more about these seats, you can  <a href=\"/abarth/695/info/manuals\">click here</a> to read the owner’s manual of your car.<br><br>⚠️ <strong>Do not drive with your body less than six inches apart from the steering wheel.</strong> You may hurt yourself badly if your car’s airbag is deployed.<br><br>⚠️ If you are about to crash, try <strong>not to cover your face </strong>with your arms or hands; trust the airbag system. If you cover your face, your hands or face may get injured.<br><br>⚠️ Airbags <strong>cannot be reused</strong>: once they have been deployed, you must replace them with new ones.<br><br>⚠️ <strong>Do not place any object in the areas where these airbags are located (not even your hands or feet).</strong> You can read the next section to know where the airbags are located, or you can read the <a href=\"/abarth/695/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.</p><h2>What kinds of airbags are there for your 695?</h2><p>There are many types of airbags according to their location in the car. The most common ones can be found inside of the space designed for both the driver and the passengers, but there are also external airbags to protect any passersby, although not all cars have them. You can read the <a href=\"/abarth/695/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> to know more about your car’s airbags.</p><p><strong>Internal airbags:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Front driver airbag: </strong>it protects the thorax and the head of the driver if there is a frontal collision. It is located in the middle of the steering wheel, and it is the most common one.</li><li><strong>Front passenger airbag: </strong>it is like the airbag for driver, but located inside of the glove box.</li><li><strong>Knee airbags: </strong>they protect the driver and the passenger from any leg and calf injuries. They are placed under the steering wheel and the glove box.</li><li><strong>Side airbags: </strong>they protect the passengers in case of side collisions by preventing their bodies from crashing into the car. They may be inside of the seats or inside of the bodywork.</li><li><strong>Curtain airbags: </strong>they protect the passengers in case of side collisions. They are mounted in the roof above the side doors and, when they activate, they cover the internal side of the cabin, both the front and the back seats. They diminish the collision with the bodywork and protect passengers from getting hurt by broken window glass.</li><li><strong>Rear airbags:</strong> They protect the heads of rear passengers. You can usually find them in compact cars. They cover the rear window in case of a collision.</li></ul><p><strong>External airbags:</strong></p><p>These airbags activate outside of the bodywork. They protect passersby if they are hit by the car. Since these airbags cannot be found in every car, you can  <a href=\"/abarth/695/info/manuals\">click here</a> to read your car’s owner’s manual to know more about them.</p><ul><li><strong>Windscreen airbags: </strong>they cover the whole windscreen.

This system works thanks to certain sensors placed strategically in the bodywork of the car and they are controlled by certain electronic modules. If there is a collision, the car will determine how strong it is and which airbags should be deployed.</p><p>As this system is usually very complex, if you notice any anomaly or if you see a warning light indicating that something is damaged, you should take your car to a specialist as soon as you can. Since these airbags are so important for both your and the other passengers’ safety, you should always have an expert deal with them.</p><h2>When do the airbags get activated in your 695?</h2><p>When the <strong>car sensors</strong> sense a collision, they send a signal to the car’s <strong>computer</strong>. If the computer decides that the collision is strong enough, it deploys the airbags to protect the people in the car.</p><p>Moments after they have been deployed, the airbags begin to deflate to cushion the collision of the body. This whole cycle happens at a great speed in hundredths of a second.</p><p>Once the airbags have been deployed, they are no longer useful; a specialist should replace them with new ones.</p><h2><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/airbags_externos.jpg\"></div></h2>"

Almost all of them work in the same way: the fluid goes through one or more sheets of porous paper in which these impurities are caught.</p><p><strong>⚠️ There is one main problem with filters:</strong></p><p>As time goes on, particles are accumulated in the filters and <strong>overload</strong> them, so the fluids (either fuel, air, or oil) cannot flow through them anymore. When this happens, we say that <strong>the filter is “clogged.”</strong></p><h2>When should you change the filters of your Grande Punto?</h2><ul><li><strong>Air filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> They must usually be replaced every <strong>7,000 miles.</strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_aire_admision.jpg\"></div>Purpose: they purify the air that gets into the cylinders. It catches any impurities that may be in the air, such as dirt, sand, plant remains, bugs, etc. It is essential to keep the internal surfaces of both cylinders and piston rings clean, which also diminishes their wear.  It is found inside the engine compartment, inside of a plastic black box (air cleaner case).</li><li><strong>Fuel filter</strong>:   <strong></strong>Fuel filters should be replaced <strong>every 10,000 miles or once a year</strong>. Diesel filters usually last longer, so it is advisable to change them after <strong>30,000 miles</strong>. <strong></strong><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_de_combustible.png\"></div>Purpose: it catches all the impurities in the fuel that may come from the fuel tank. It prevents the injectors, as well as some other parts of the fuel feed system, from getting dirty. In Diesel cars, they also catch the water that may be in the fuel.This filter is usually close to the fuel tank in gasoline cars, and you can access it right under it. On the other hand, in Diesel cars, this filter is placed inside the engine compartment.</li><li><strong>Motor oil filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> They must usually be replaced <strong>every 5,000 - 10,000 miles (when you change the oil).</strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_aceite.jpg\"></div>Purpose: one of the purposes of the motor oil is to clean the engine and prevent dirt from sticking into metallic surfaces. The dirt transported by the oil is caught in the filter to prevent it from flowing into the engine. It also catches any metallic pieces that come from the engine wear. It is essential to keep the wear of all the internal parts of the engine to a minimum. It is attached to the engine block (monobloc), in front or next to the engine.</li><li><strong>Transmission fluid filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> Replace it or at least clean it every time you change the transmission fluid. In <strong>automatic cars</strong>, change it every <strong>25,000 miles</strong>, and in <strong>manual cars</strong> every <strong>50,000 miles</strong>.<strong></strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_transmision_aut.jpg\"></div> Purpose: They are commonly found in automatic transmission cars, since they catch any impurities created in them, preventing the wear and keeping the transmission working properly. They are located inside the transmission.</li><li><strong>Cabin air filter (or pollen filter)</strong>:   <strong></strong> They must usually be replaced every <strong>6,000 - 20,000 miles</strong>, depending on how dirty they are<strong>.</strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_de_habitaculo.jpg\"></div>Purpose: they catch any impurities brought by the air that enters the cabin due to the air conditioner. It stops dust and pollen particles, bugs, and plant remains. They are not really necessary for the car to work correctly, but they help the passengers feel more comfortable. They are placed inside of the ventilation duct, on the passenger seat’s side.</li></ul><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">⚠️ <strong>Warning</strong>: sometimes, the <strong>change periods vary a lot</strong> depending on how much dirt these filters have accumulated. For example, if you drive in areas where there is a lot of dust in the air, you will have to change the air and cabin filters more frequently than if you drive in a city. The same happens with fuel filters: if the fuel you use is not of good quality, it would be better to change it more frequently.</p><p>We have stated the standard periods to change these filters, but you should always change them according to the periods stated in your  Grande Punto‘s  <a href=\"/abarth/grande-punto/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.</p><p>Please take into account that some filters are more important than others since they have an impact on the way the car works, but all of them <strong>should be checked periodically</strong> by you or by a specialist.</p>",

                        "<h2>What is the oxygen sensor (or lambda sensor) of your Grande Punto?</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In short:<br></strong>The oxygen sensor, also known as the <strong>lambda sensor</strong>, is in the exhaust system and <strong>measures the oxygen level in the exhaust gases</strong>. This information is later used by the central computer of your Grande Punto (ECU or PCM) to control the fuel injection and allow the engine to work efficiently without wasting fuel or reducing its efficiency.</p><p>The exhaust system may have 1 or 2 oxygen sensors. The main one is in the inlet of the catalytic converter, and it monitors the gases that come out of the engine. The second one (if your car has one) is in the catalytic converter outlet, and its purpose is to monitor its performance. It is important to remember that if the catalytic converter malfunctions, extremely pollutant gases will be released into the atmosphere. The oxygen sensor usually begins to fail after the car has driven from <strong>55,000 to 90,000 miles (90,000 to 140,000 km), </strong>and that is when you should replace it.

This sensor is small, and its parts are immovable. It has a small hose that is placed in a hole that leads to the inside of the air circuit.</p><p>To function, the engine always tries to draw air in, but the butterfly valve blocks it partially. This creates a depression (a “negative” pressure) inside the intake manifold. It is like sucking the air in an empty plastic bottle. The faster the engine spins, and/or, the tighter this butterfly valve is closed, the bigger this depression will get. With this and some other pieces of information, the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) estimates the engine load (the burden placed on the engine) and adjusts the fuel injection to keep its optimal performance and minimize its fuel consumption.</p><h2>Signs that show that your Grande Punto‘s MAP sensor is faulty</h2><ul><li>The <em>Check engine</em> light comes on</li><li>Erratic speed: sometimes you cannot speed up, the acceleration may be slow, or your car may decelerate</li><li>Increased smoke emissions</li></ul><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️ <strong>Some other problems may cause symptoms similar to those of a faulty MAP sensor</strong>, for example, vacuum leaks.

If the caps are damaged or loose, this pressure and the liquid will leak.</li><li><strong>Not enough lubricant:</strong> when the friction between the internal pieces increase, the temperature and the wear increase significantly, and this may cause severe damages if it is not fixed on time.</li><li><strong>The cylinder heads may be broken: </strong>the combustion gases get into the refrigeration system, and this will increase the temperature and form gas bubbles.</li></ul><h2>How does the system that cools the engine of your Grande Punto work?</h2><p>All engines have a cooling system, which works by taking the heat from the engine to the radiator.</p><p>This system is quite simple, and it includes the following parts:</p><ul><li>Coolant</li><li>Radiator</li><li>Coolant pump</li><li>Temperature sensor</li><li>Thermostat</li><li>Electric fan</li></ul><p>The engine cools thanks to the <strong>coolant</strong>, or “antifreeze.” You can usually buy it at gas stations when you “check the fluids.” It is typically green or pink. <strong>You must never use just water; this will damage the engine in a very short time period.</strong></p><p>You can see how this system works in the following image: the liquid takes the heat generated by the engine and takes it to the <strong>radiator</strong>. There is a <strong>pump </strong>that makes the liquid flow, and it pushes it along the circuit. The hot liquid enters through the upper part of the radiator, and it comes out being cool from the bottom part.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/bbb1b168_Sin título1.png\"></div><p></p><p>In order to keep its good performance, the engine of your Grande Punto must always stay within the optimal temperature range, which is usually around 190ºF (90°C). To guarantee this temperature, the system has two “auxiliary” pieces that control temperatures: the thermostat and the electric fan. The <strong>thermostat </strong>prevents the coolant from cooling too much, and the <strong>electric fan</strong> stops it from heating.</p><p>The<strong> temperature sensor</strong> monitors the whole system that is usually controlled by the central computer or by a separate electronic module, depending on the car manufacturer.</p><p>Like in every system, any of these parts may malfunction or get damaged, and that will make the engine overheat, as we explained above.</p>",

Moreover, if the car has a diesel engine, this system will also block the “stop” relay, which will prevent the fuel from being injected into the engine. Sometimes, this system will also block the steering column which will lock the steering wheel.</p><h2>Why is the immobilizer activated on a Grande Punto?</h2><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">The main reason is because the car's computer does not recognize or does not detect the signal sent by the chip which is inside the key. The most common reasons as to why this happens are:<br><br>⚠️ <strong>Low battery of the key or the remote control:</strong> the chip will not send the signal.<br><br>⚠️<strong> The chip of the key is damaged or has been decoded</strong>: it may happen if the key is damaged or if it gets wet.<br><br>⚠️ <strong>Faulty electrical wiring:</strong> it may happen both in the antenna as well as in the immobilizer unit or the engine's computer.</p><p>Less frequent causes:</p><ul><li><strong>Damaged antenna</strong>: due to electrical reasons, the antenna may stop working.</li><li><strong>Lack of synchronization of the immobilizer unit.</strong></li><li><strong>Electronic failure</strong>: any of the contacts or internal electronic components of the module or the computer may get damaged.</li></ul><h2>How can I fix an immobilizer problem on a Grande Punto?</h2><p>Since this system is delicate, it is advisable to leave this process in the hands of a specialist.</p><p>First, the technician will <strong>scan the car</strong> with the adequate diagnosis equipment to check if the problem is actually related to the immobilizer system.</p><p>If that is the case, the technician will have to identify the cause among the causes already mentioned and then see if this problem can be solved via programming or if it is necessary to replace any of the components.</p><h2>How does the immobilizer or anti-theft system or your Grande Punto work?</h2><p>Each <strong>original key</strong> has a chip inside which sends a signal when it gets close to the ignition switch. Inside the switch there is an antenna which receives this signal and sends it to the car's computer. If the signal is the same as the one the car has saved, then the driver will be allowed to start the car.</p><p>The immobilizer is automatic and manual activation is never needed.

And even if you can repair it, the cost will be extremely high.<br></p><p>This oil also “softens” friction between the different movable pieces of your car’s engine. It eliminates any direct contact between two surfaces in movement by creating a fluid layer among them. If this oil did not exist, these pieces would get worn out faster, and there would be so much heat created that the metals would melt and stick to each other, which would produce a lot of damage, most of it irreversible. This phenomenon is known as metal seizure.<br></p><p>Generally, good lubrication <strong>reduces engine wear and noise, and saves energy </strong>because of the diminished friction between different moving parts,<strong> and reduces maintenance costs.</strong><br></p><p>Their additives also have different roles, and they generally can be found altogether in motor oils:<br></p><ul><li><strong>They inhibit corrosion </strong>and prevent the engine from <strong>getting rusty</strong><br></li><li>They are dispersant: they <strong>prevent</strong> the dirt from forming any <strong>lumps,</strong> which may block any holes or become abrasive<br></li><li>They have a cleaning function: they <strong>clean</strong> the surfaces<br></li><li>They are <strong>defoamers</strong>: they prevent any air bubbles from creating<br></li><li>Their <strong>anti-friction</strong> properties reduce the friction between pieces even more<br></li><li>They work as <strong>antioxidants</strong>: they avoid the deterioration of the oil itself<br></li><li>They enhance viscosity: they allow the <strong>viscosity levels to stay high even at high temperatures</strong><br></li></ul>",

You will find the rest of specifications such as <strong>viscosity and quality</strong> in the <a href=\"/abarth/grande-punto/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> of your Grande Punto.</p><h2>What is oil viscosity and which is better for your Grande Punto?</h2><p>Viscosity is a <strong>measure of an oil’s resistance to flow</strong>: The thicker (higher viscosity) the oil, the slower it will flow and it will take more time to reach every part of the engine. It is commonly said that the oil is \"heavier\" when it is more viscous and \"lighter\" in the opposite case. Viscosity grades are measured based on SAE standards. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p>We advise you to look for the recommended viscosity in your <a href=\"/abarth/grande-punto/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> or ask your trusted mechanic. If you can’t find the information and you have to change the engine oil, this is what you have to know: </p><p>When engines work at low temperatures (engine start), the oil should be more fluid in order to reach every part of the engine and ensure immediate lubrication. After a few minutes, the temperature of the engine will rise and, ideally, the oil viscosity should be higher. This ensures proper lubrication without breaking the lubricant film. Nowadays, all oils meet this requirement and they are called <strong>multigrade oils </strong>(lower viscosity at cold temperatures and higher viscosity at hot temperatures).</p><p><strong>A medium viscosity level would be the SAE 10W-40 engine oil</strong>, which meet the needs of the current car models without difficulty.</p><p>If you live in a place where the temperature drops to 14° F (-10° C) or less you should use an oil with lower viscosity (5W-40 for example).<strong></strong></p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\"> ⚠️ If your vehicle has over 124,000 mi and consumes oil or you see some white smoke coming from the exhaust pipe, you can use an oil with a slightly higher viscosity to compensate for wear. </p><h2>Which engine oil should your Grande Punto use?</h2><p><strong></strong>You can find the specific engine oil quality for your Grande Punto in <strong>the Maintenance section </strong>of your <a href=\"/abarth/grande-punto/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.

The idle speed, also known simply as “idle,” is the amount of revolutions that the engine keeps when our foot is not pressing the accelerator. The IAC valve is controlled by the computer and it balances any burden upon the engine, like the usage of the air conditioner, the lights or the sound system. When the engine is cold, it helps it start by keeping the revolutions somewhat higher until the engine heats up.</p><h2>Symptoms that show that your Grande Punto‘s IAC valve is failing</h2><ul><li>The engine stalls when the car is idling (idle speed)</li><li>It is hard to start the vehicle when the engine is cold</li><li>Unstable revolutions that go up and down</li><li>The engine stalls if the air conditioner is turned on</li><li>The “check engine” light comes on</li></ul><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️ You should check the IAC valve periodically to make sure it is clean, since it usually malfunctions because of the accumulation of carbon residue which is produced by the combustion of the engine.</p>",

It should not move more than 1 inch (2.5cm).<br>- The booster seat should be <strong>facing the rear until the child is four years old.</strong><br>- Make sure to <strong>check the anchor of the seat periodically</strong>. Research has shown that <strong>3 out of 5 booster seats are not fixed properly</strong>.</p><h2>How should children travel in your Grande Punto?</h2><p>Children should always be <strong>restrained by booster seats; </strong>they must never roam freely inside the car or sit in your lap. This should be the case <strong>until they are at least 51 inches tall</strong> (1.4 meters). This system is generically known as child restraint system.</p><p>In most countries, the law states that children should be facing the rear up until they are one year old, but specialists have stated that they should sit that way <strong>until they are four years old</strong> because that is when their cervical muscles can endure a frontal collision without getting badly injured.</p><p>Children may stop using booster seats when:</p><ul><li>They can <strong>bend their knees</strong> naturally while sitting down with their hip touching the back of the seat.</li><li><strong>The chest safety belt</strong> is on <strong>their shoulders,</strong> and not their necks.</li><li><strong>The abdominal safety belt </strong>is on their hip, between their legs and abdomen.</li></ul><p>Although many countries regulate this depending on the child’s age, and not their size, <strong>you should always consider your children’s weight and height</strong>, not their age.</p><h2>Can you use any kind of booster seat in your Grande Punto?</h2><p><strong>NO.</strong> Booster seats for children <strong>are classified</strong> into different groups according to the <strong>child’s size and weight</strong>. They also include different <strong>anchors</strong> for the seat: the <strong>traditional </strong>system (with a safety belt), <strong>ISOFIX,</strong> or <strong>LATCH</strong>. You should choose the right one both for your children and your car. If you want to know which one to use, you should read the <a href=\"/abarth/grande-punto/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> of your Grande Punto. Take into account that different brands may have different ways to anchor the seats, but they should always be <strong>certified according to the regulations</strong> we will now mention.</p><h2>Booster seat sizes</h2><p>Booster seats can be categorized according to the 3 main safety regulations: the <strong>FMVSS 213</strong> (American) and european <strong>ECE R44</strong> and <strong>UN R129</strong> (a.k.a. <strong>i-Size</strong>, newer and more complete). R44 categorizes according to the weight of the child, i-Size is based on height and the american FMV is a mix between both.</p><p class=\"ArticleWarning\"><strong>The American regulation has three groups:</strong><br><br><strong>Infant:</strong> for children whose size is up to 32 inches (or 0.8 meters) and their weight between 4 and 35 pounds (or 2 to 16 kilograms). These seats are meant to face the rear.<br><br><strong>Convertible: </strong>for children whose size is between 19 and 45 inches (or 0.5 and 1.2 meters). They are meant for children who are between 5 and 40 pounds (or 2 to 18 kilograms), and you should place them facing the rear, unless the child’s weight is between 20 and 65 pounds (or between 9 and 30 kilograms), since they can already face forward at that point.<br><br><strong>Booster</strong>: Up to 65 inches (or 1.65 meters) and 120 pounds (55 kilograms).

You can use the former in any car because they can be anchored with a seatbelt. Semi-universal seats are called  <strong>LATCH</strong> seats (according to the American regulations) and <strong>ISOFIX</strong> (according to the European regulations).

                        "<h2> Exhaust smoke and its colors on a Grande Punto: causes and severity</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In a few words:</strong><br>According to the color of the exhaust smoke that is released from the exhaust pipe of your Grande Punto you will be able to identify the possible causes. The colors of the exhaust smoke that your Grande Punto may produce will help you find the problem. In <strong>order of priority </strong>from the least to the most dangerous, these colors are:<strong> white, blue, black, mix of two colors</strong>.</p><p>First, it should be said that the exhaust gas that is usually released through the exhaust pipe of your car is basically <strong>invisible</strong>. You should see a faint and short-lived exhaust that fades shortly after appearing only if you speed up abruptly. If your Grande Punto discharges visible exhaust smoke then it is very likely that you need to take it to a specialist.</p><h2>White exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a Grande Punto</h2><p>The exhaust gas that comes out without strength and elevates considerably (it may get over the roof) but then fades without any trace when your car is idling may only be <strong>water vapor.</strong> This exhaust does not smell like anything in particular and it can be seen if the temperature is low or if there is humidity. <strong>If this is the case, do not worry.</strong></p><p><strong>If the white exhaust smoke does not fade, it is dense and smells, then</strong> it is associated with a <strong>coolant leak</strong>. In this case, the <strong>coolant level</strong> of your Grande Punto <strong>should be low</strong>. Have your car checked up by a specialist to confirm this leak and prevent your engine from overheating.</p><p>⚠️<strong> Check the recovery tank. </strong>If you see that the <strong>coolant is bubbling</strong> that means that it is leaking into the combustion chamber. This is caused by a leak of exhaust gases into the cooling system. If your car has these symptoms <strong>you should</strong> <strong>have your engine checked</strong> by a specialist at once since this malfunction may bring serious problems.</p><p>This liquid leak may be caused by the following reasons:</p><ul><li>The cylinder head gasket is damaged (which is the cheapest problem to fix)</li><li>The cylinder head or the engine block are cracked (which is more expensive)</li></ul><h2>Blue exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a Grande Punto</h2><p>At first sight this exhaust smoke seems white but it has a <strong>blueish tone, a certain density and a particular smell, like something is burning. </strong>Moreover, its <strong>volume increases significantly when you step on the accelerator.</strong></p><p>This blue exhaust smoke indicates that the <strong>lubricant oil is burning</strong>, either because there is a leak into the inside of the combustion chamber or a leak into the exhaust system.</p><p>⚠️ <strong>Check if the level of lubricant oil</strong> of your Grande Punto <strong>is decreasing drastically</strong> to verify if that is the cause.</p><p>The causes for this lubricant leak are usually the following:</p><ul><li><strong>The valve stem seals are in a bad shape</strong></li><li>The <strong>piston rings are worn down</strong></li><li>Leaks of oil in the supercharger (if the engine of you Grande Punto has this system)</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, fixing any of these problems is expensive and they usually affect<strong> high mileage engines</strong> (with more than 90,000 miles) or cars with <strong>badly battered engines</strong>.</p><p><strong>If the exhaust smoke is blue but it is not too dense</strong>, it may be caused by a blockage in the crankcase ventilation system.</p><p>⚠️ In this case, <strong>the exhaust smoke will come from the engine and not from the exhaust pipe</strong>.</p><p>It is normal to see blueish exhaust coming from the exhaust pipe of mopeds and motorbikes with a two-stroke engine, and, in those cases, this exhaust is not caused by a failure.</p><h2>Black exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a Grande Punto</h2><p>This problem <strong>is usually seen in diesel engines</strong> and it is caused by a <strong>great increase in the amount of fuel supplied to the engine</strong>, that is to say, the engine is burning more fuel than it should.</p><p>⚠️ Check if the <strong>consumption of fuel</strong> of your Grande Punto <strong>has increased significantly</strong>.<strong> You should also notice</strong> this because of <strong>the reduction of power </strong>of the engine.</p><p>You can also verify this flaw by <strong>putting a white cloth inside the exhaust pipe, clogging it up for a few seconds</strong>. This cloth will <strong>turn black</strong> instantly due to the expelled coal particles.</p><p>This black color is caused by the generation of hydrocarbons that are not completely burnt. They create more <strong>carbonaceous particles</strong> which soil the lubricant oil and they settle in each nook and cranny of the engine of your Grande Punto. At the same time, they are also accumulated inside the combustion chamber as hard crusts that are abrasive and wear down movable pieces.</p><p>The exhaust system is also affected because of the accumulation of cinder, which also poses a threat to the catalytic converter, the particle filter or the muffler of the car.</p><p>This problem may be caused by any of the following items:</p><ul><li>The air filter is too dirty.</li><li>The fuel injectors, the fuel pressure regulator, the throttle position sensor (TPS), or the Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor are dirty or there is an electrical flaw in them.</li><li>The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve is malfunctioning (this valve recirculates the exhaust gases back to the engine). When you accelerate, this EGR valve remains open so that the exhaust gases can get inside the engine once again.</li></ul><h2>Two-colored exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a Grande Punto</h2><p>In the worst case scenario the released exhaust will be two-colored. This means that there are many simultaneous causes for this problem and it is important that a specialist investigates this as soon as possible to prevent further failures.</p>",
                        "<h2>What do the technical specifications of your Grande Punto’s engine mean?</h2><p>Even though all engines are very similar when you look at them, there are many different types. We will now show you what the most usual technical specifications that you can find in the <strong>technical datasheet</strong> of your <strong> Grande Punto </strong>mean.</p><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Gasoline or Diesel engines</strong><br><br>This is the main difference between engines. Engines that need Diesel have incandescent spark plugs that only work when the car starts. Once the engine is running, the fuel ignites by itself since it is compressed inside the cylinders thanks to the high temperature it reaches.<br>On the other hand, gasoline engines work thanks to the spark constantly created by the spark plugs. This means that they work all the time the engine is running.<br>Another difference between these two engines is that Diesel engines are generally heavier, and their structure is more robust.</li><li><strong>Number of cylinders</strong><br><br>It is the <strong>number</strong> of cylinders inside the engine. <strong>The engine power is generated </strong>in the cylinders because that is where the pistons are. For this reason, the more cylinders the engine has, the more its power will be. This also means that the engine will be bigger and heavier. It is also important to notice that if there are a lot of cylinders, the engine will consume more fuel. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/bloque.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Bore/stroke ratio</strong><br><br><strong>These are the piston’s measurements, </strong>and they can be expressed in centimeters or inches. They indicate the cylinder diameter (bore) and the longitudinal displacement (stroke) that the piston does inside the cylinder when the engine is running. These measurements allow us to measure the “displaced volume” by the piston. <strong>If the diameter is wide and the piston has a short stroke, the engine will be fit for sports cars.</strong> In other words, the revolutions per minute (RPMs) will be high.  <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/cf9931c1_carrera y diametro.png\"></div></li><li><strong>Engine displacement</strong><br><br>It is the total available volume in the engine cylinders. It is calculated by multiplying the stroke length, the bore, and the number of cylinders.<br>Depending on the country, it may be expressed in liters (1.6 L, 2.0 L, 3.6 L), or in cubic inches (98, 110, 250, 510 CI).<br>Generally, <strong>the higher the engine displacement is, the more power your car will have, but the higher its fuel consumption will be.</strong></li><li><strong>Cylinder arrangement</strong><br><br>a) In-line arrangement: nowadays, it is hard to find engines with more than 6 in-line cylinders because they take up too much space under the hood.<br><br>b) V-type arrangement: They are more compact and create fewer vibrations, but they can only be used with an even number of cylinders (V6, V8, V10, etc.).<br><br>c) Opposed arrangement: they are flat and not frequently used because their manufacture and maintenance are very demanding. Moreover, like the V-type arrangement, they can only be used with an even number of cylinders. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/tipo_de_motor.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Valvetrain type: SOHC and DOHC</strong><br><br>a) SOHC (single overhead camshaft):  It only has one camshaft placed in the cylinder head. Only one camshaft controls all the engine’s valves. They generally have more power if there are low RPMs. The camshaft is in charge of opening and closing the engine’s valves.<br>b) DOHC (double overhead camshaft): It has two camshafts placed in the cylinder head. One camshaft controls the admission valve while the other controls the escape valve. The performance of these engines is usually better if the RPMs are high. Moreover, its parts are usually lighter and can move faster.</li><li><strong>Compression ratio</strong><br><br><strong>It is the measurement of how much the volume of the air-fuel mixture can be compressed inside of the cylinder.</strong> The higher this number is, the higher the engine power will be. For example, if there is an 8:1 ratio, this means that the mixture will be reduced to one octave of its original volume.<br>Generally, compression ratios are between 8:1 and 12:1 for gasoline engines.</li><li><strong>Naturally aspirated or turbo engines</strong><br><br>A <strong>naturally aspired</strong> engine means <strong>that the engine draws air directly through an air intake.</strong> In turbocharged cars, on the other hand,<strong> the turbocharger injects air by forcing it into the engine.</strong> The advantage of using turbochargers is that, in small engines, the power increases because it is possible to inject more air and fuel into the cylinders.</li><li><strong> Torque</strong><br><br><strong>It is the “strength” that the engine has when it accelerates.</strong><br>It is measured in “foot-pounds” or in “N.m” (1 N.m = 0.737 ft.lb), and to express it, the RPM of the engine must also be stated. For example: 150 N.m @ 1700 RPM.<br>Off-road cars usually have a lot of torque and not so much power. This enables them to drive up big slopes at a slow speed or dodge big pits and rocks. Diesel engines have more torque than gasoline engines.</li><li><strong> Power</strong><br><br><strong>It is the car’s ability to accelerate (to react) at high speeds.</strong><br>It is measured in HP (Horse Power), or in KW (1 HP = 0.745 KW).</li><li><strong> Revolutions per minute (RPM)</strong><br><br><strong>They represent the engine speed. It is important to distinguish them from the car speed since they are not the same thing.</strong> Both are related by the transmission. For example, if the car is in neutral gear and we press the accelerator, we may only change the engine speed but not the car speed.<br>Technically speaking: <em>Torque x RPM = Power</em><br>In a car, the RPM are controlled by the accelerator. Their rise depends on how much we press the accelerator, and this will be reflected in the tachometer. The higher the RPMs are, the noisier the engine will be.</li></ol>",

                        "<h2>How to keep your Grande Punto safe during extended periods without use</h2><p>If your Grande Punto has to stay in one place for a long time, here are some recommendations to keep your car in the best possible condition.</p><p><strong>Battery:</strong> Disconnect the negative terminal of the battery. This will prevent the electrical components from consuming it, and it will prevent any future problems when you start your Grande Punto.</p><p><strong>Tires: </strong>Inflate your car’s tires with more pressure than the recommended one for driving. Either 3 or 4 psi should be enough. Like this, they will not get deformed when they naturally deflate.</p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">If you will not use your Grande Punto for a few months, you can also create some sort of support with bricks (or any other elements) and place it under the chassis so that it can help the wheels hold the weight of the car when the wheels deflate.</p><p><strong>Fuel:</strong> Ideally, the fuel tank should be full. If there is less air inside of the tank, there is less probability of it evaporating. Additionally, like this, if the tank is metallic, you will prevent its rusting.</p><p><strong>Hand brake:</strong> You must never activate it unless it is really necessary. It has a wire in its mechanism, and if this wire stays taut for a long period, it may get damaged. Also the brake pad (brake shoe) may get stuck or corrode the pieces it is in contact with.</p><p><strong>Fluids and oils:</strong> Check that the levels of refrigerant, steering fluid, brake fluid, and oil of your Grande Punto are the recommended ones.</p><p><strong>Start:</strong> If you can, start your Grande Punto once every ten days. This will prevent the wear of the mechanical pieces of the engine, and it will recharge the battery. During those moments, you should also turn the air conditioner on, move the automatic windows and turn all the lights on and off. The movement of the circuits will keep your car in good shape.</p><p><strong>Exhaust pipe: </strong>Put a small cloth with motor oil in the external part of the exhaust pipe to prevent corrosion.</p><p><strong>Cleaning: </strong>Prevent bad smells and mold in the car by cleaning the inside of the car thoroughly.

Since headlamps are more complex, there are many types. They are the ones that illuminate the road ahead without dazzling the other drivers. Brake lights are only there to be seen at a sensible distance by the drivers behind you, and their purpose is to light up when you press the brake pedal.</p><p><strong>Generally, changing these bulbs is easy,</strong> and you can do it yourself. Cars have a different lighting system from that of a house since they are guaranteed to keep working despite the vehicle’s vibrations. You only have to make sure that their <strong>pigtail wire has been properly connected</strong>. You will know they have been connected properly because <strong>there is only one way they can be connected</strong>.</p><p>You should <strong>have a spare bulb in your Grande Punto</strong> if you are about to go on a road trip. Even if <strong>a bulb has a lifespan of several years</strong>, they are cheap and it never hurts to be careful.</p><ul><li><strong>LED lamps</strong></li></ul><p>The main advantage of LED lamps is their <strong>efficiency</strong>: they produce <strong>a lot of light,</strong> and they <strong>draw less electrical energy (</strong>up to 80% less<strong>)</strong>. Moreover, their <strong>lifespan is 25 times longer</strong> than the lifespan of a halogen lamp. LED lamps are <strong>instantly on</strong> and, since the component that produces light is relatively small, these lamps can be created in any shape or form. They are made of semiconductor materials enclosed in a small, plastic shell and only one lamp may produce different colors.</p><p>There are a lot of high-end brands that use LED technology for their products, but their usage of fixed LED light panels makes it almost impossible for them to be changed without having to visit an authorized car dealer.</p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/0af84ef3_Untitled4-628x280.png\"></div><p></p><ul><li><strong>Incandescent lamps</strong></li></ul><p>They are the <strong>oldest ones, they consume a lot of energy and create a lot of heat.</strong> They are made up of a metallic filament which is protected by a transparent glass bulb. When the electricity goes through the filament, it turns bright red and it produces light. Nowadays, these lamps are still used to illuminate <strong>car interiors, dashboard lights, brake lights, direction-indicator lights, and front position lights</strong>, since these lights do not need to be too powerful. They have different watts, sizes, and shapes according to their usage. They may have 1 or 2 filaments (just like the brake lights).</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/e7ba5170_Incandenscentes.jpg\"></div><p></p><ul><li><strong>Halogen lamps</strong></li></ul><p><strong>They are the enhanced version of incandescent lamps.</strong> <strong>The light they produce is stronger and whiter.</strong> They work the same way; the only difference is that the glass bulb encloses halogen gas, which improves the filament’s output and, therefore, also enhances its lifespan. For these reasons, these lamps are more efficient, and small halogen lamps may be powerful.</p><p>These lamps may have <strong>different</strong> amounts of filaments, their filaments may be placed in different positions, and the shape of their bulbs may be different. The most common ones are these: </p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/412a152f_Halógenas2.jpg\"></div><p></p><p><strong>H1 lamps</strong>: <strong>They are used in fog lamps and high beam lights.</strong> They only have one filament placed longitudinally and they have a compact shape. There are 55, 70 and, 100-W H1 lamps.</p><p><strong>H3 lamps</strong>: They are usually used in <strong>fog lamps and long-range lights</strong>, and they have only one filament, which is placed transversely. They are the most compact ones. They only include a small wire to connect them. There are 55, 70 and 100-W H3 lamps.</p><p><strong>H4 lamps</strong>: They are the most used in <strong>headlamps because they can also be used as dipped beam headlights and high beam lights, which saves space.</strong> They have two filaments, and they are bigger than the other types of lamps. There are usually 55/60, 70/75, and 90/100-W H4 lamps (for crossings/highways).</p><p><strong>H7 lamps</strong>: They are mainly used in <strong>fog lamps</strong>. They only have one linear filament, and they are somewhat bigger than H1 and H3 lamps.</p><ul><li><strong>Xenon lamps</strong></li></ul><p><strong>They are the brightest ones,</strong> and the light they produce is whiter than the one made by halogen lamps. Their downside is that the electrical energy needed to turn these lamps on must be high (30,000 V). Their arc needs a high current, so they need auxiliary equipment called reactance, which is in charge of controlling the electrical energy of the lamp. If you are thinking of switching to Xenon’s lamps, an auto mechanic should do it for you.</p><p><strong>These lights take one minute to reach their maximum power.</strong> The good thing is that once you turn these lights on, they <strong>consume less electricity than halogen lamps</strong>, <strong>generate less heat and their lifespan is way longer.</strong> They are <strong>more expensive</strong> than the other lamps.</p><p>Regarding their structure, they do not have filaments. They have two electrodes, separated by a few millimeters protected by a glass bulb where there is high-pressure Xenon gas. An electrical arc that produces light is created between these two electrodes. You can see this light in the following image.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/5f306ae3_xenon-lampara3.jpg\"></div><p></p>",

This happens inside of the cylinders, and the <strong>spark plugs</strong> are the ones that create it.</p><p>Spark plugs are only used in Otto cycle engines, which are usually called “gasoline” engines. This means that Diesel cars do not have spark plugs.</p><p>It is common for engines to have just one spark plug per cylinder. They are screwed into the lid, called cylinder head, and there is one part of them inside, and its connector is outside. They are connected to the ignition coil through a thick wire with a cap on its cover, as seen in the image below. </p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/cable_bujia.jpg\"></div><p></p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/bujia2.jpg\"></div><p></p><p>The ignition coil creates the high current necessary for the spark plug, which makes the spark that starts the fuel ignition process.

If your car is very loaded, you could go up to 38 psi without  problems. For sport cars (with very low profile tires), the usual thing to do  is to  inflate them to<strong> ​40 psi​. </strong><br><strong>2- ​Look up the recommendation in your  <a href=\"/abarth/grande-punto/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a></strong>.  <br><strong>3- Look up the tag in your car. </strong>​You can find it sticked in the internal frame of the  driver’s door, in the fuel-charger lid or in the sun shield. It will look like this one you  can see here:  <br></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/c2f52106_Caclo de presion generica.JPG\"></div> <br><p></p><h2>How should I interpret the chart of the tires’ pressure of my  Grande Punto? </h2><p>The tag with the recommended pressures varies according to the car’s  manufacturer. Here we show you an example where you will be able to see how to  interpret its data: </p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/etiqueta_neumaticos_2.PNG\"></div> <p></p><p>A - The columns on the right show the pressure of the back tires.  </p><p>B - The columns on the left show the pressure of the front tires. </p><p>C - If we read the  rows horizontally we will see that there is a recommended  pressure according to the load that our car will carry (represented in people and  luggage).  </p><p>D - The information that appears at the bottom is the recommended pressure for  your temporary auxiliary tire, which is not the same as the one recommended for the  rest of the tires, due to its smaller size. </p><p>E - The data ​T125/60​ and  R18 which appears in this example corresponds to the  measurements of the temporary auxiliary tire.  </p><p>Depending on the country of origin of your Grande Punto, the pressure of the tires  may be measured in  \"psi\" (commonly called “pounds”) in  \"bar\" or in “Kpa”.  That’s why in your car’s chart you can find any of them. Take  the machine that you will use for the measurements and <strong>check which unit it uses  and ​consider only that data in the tag​.</strong> The other data  will be the equivalent in other  units, so you don’t need to use it.</p><h2>When shall I check the pressure of the tires of my Grande Punto? </h2><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">⚠   <strong>We recommend you to check the pressure of the tires once every 15 days​</strong> and every time you are  about to start a long trip. You must do this measurement<strong> with ​cold tires for it to be precise. </strong>​Meaning,  don’t do it in the middle of a long journey because you will probably get a useless reading. Keep in mind that, while running, the tires get naturally deformed, by producing heat and absorbing the heat  from the road. The temperature rise makes ​the pressure to rise​ as well and then we might get higher values than we should in the measurement. </p><h2>Why is it important to respect the recommended pressure in your Grande Punto? </h2><p>The tires’ pressure was well studied by the manufacturers in order to guarantee: </p><ul><li> <strong>Security​: </strong>it improves the maneuverability and the stability and reduces the  braking. Also, it reduces the temperature of the tires, lessening the  chances of having punctures. </li><li> <strong>Fuel efficiency​: </strong>tires with the appropriate pressure generate less  resistance for the wheels and will therefore spend less fuel, contributing  both to saving money and with the environment.</li><li><strong> Reduces tire erosion: </strong>​the tires will be deformed less and will be less  mechanically demanded. In consequence, they will have longer life time. On top of this, the tire’s erosion will be even in the whole tire.<strong>Comfort​</strong>: you will feel that your car is more stable and will feel less the  potential irregularities of the road (because you will have better shock  absorbency). </li></ul><h2>Erosion according with the tire inflation level on a Grande Punto </h2><p>The correct tire inflation level ensures that the tires’ footprint is optimal. More or  less pressure will provoque undesired deformations.

The two of them are derived from petroleum, and they are formed by hydrocarbons (hydrogen and carbon molecules).</p><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️  <strong>The main rule is that you must only use diesel in Diesel engines and gasoline in spark-ignition engines </strong>(called “Otto cycle engines”).<strong> Otherwise, the engine of your Grande Punto may get ruined.</strong></p><p>To obtain energy from fuel, it must be burning: in a Diesel engine, the diesel burns because of the compression, and in an Otto cycle engine, it burns by a spark created by the spark plug. For this reason, each type of fuel has different characteristics: diesel is more oily and takes longer to burn, while gasoline is more volatile and burns a lot faster.</p><p>Diesel engines are more efficient than Otto engines, but their exhaust smoke is more contaminant. For this reason, they have to go through certain processes to comply with the pollution prevention laws, and that makes them more expensive.</p><p><strong>Natural gas </strong>is the third type of fuel, and it is mainly used in Latin-American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. To use it, many modifications should be made to the fuel system of the car, and a certified company should do it. This type of fuel makes the car have less autonomy than the other ones, so the engine’s performance may not be ideal, but since it is <strong>a lot cheaper</strong>, it is also popular.</p><p>There are two other types of fuel that are massively used: <strong>biodiesel </strong>and <strong>ethanol</strong> (ethylic alcohol). They are generally used as additives, the first one for Diesel fuel and the second one for gasoline.

                        "<h2> How to improve the fuel consumption of your Grande Punto</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In a few words:</strong><br>Fuel is the only <strong>source of energy</strong> that powers your Grande Punto, and consequently <strong>all the elements </strong>you might need <strong>that consume</strong> energy such as lights, music and air conditioning <strong>will impact</strong> directly on the amount of fuel used. If you decrease their usage you will see improved fuel economy. Another way of optimizing fuel consumption is by using the recommended type of fuel for your Grande Punto.</p><p><strong> </strong>To know the recommended fuel for your Grande Punto you can check the <a href=\"/abarth/grande-punto/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>. <strong></strong></p><p><strong>It is important to use the recommended fuel so that the fuel consumption of your Grande Punto is optimal.</strong></p><h2>Common factors that affect the normal fuel consumption on a Grande Punto:</h2><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Driving manner: drive in a stable manner.</strong> Aggressive acceleration and braking will drastically increase fuel consumption since they require more engine power.</li><li><strong>If the car has a manual transmission, do not step on the clutch pedal as soon as you step on the brakes:</strong> cars with electronic fuel injection usually cut fuel supply when you stop stepping on the accelerator when the car is put in gear. Take advantage of the “engine braking” by letting the car stop on its own. In this way fuel consumption will decrease A LOT.</li><li><strong>Speed</strong>: the higher the speed, the greater the power needed. <strong>On highways, the optimal speed is of 60 mph with the car set in its highest gear.</strong> If we take into account the laws of physics, doubling the speed means increasing the power 8 times.</li><li><strong>Air conditioner</strong>: Always use the air conditioner in <strong>“recirculation” mode</strong>. Air conditioning consumes quite a lot of the engine's energy. Cooling the air inside the cabin is a lot easier than cooling the air coming from outside constantly. On the other hand, as the air conditioner compressor is usually mechanically connected to the engine, if there are more engine revolutions the energy consumption will increase.</li><li><strong>Tire pressure</strong>: it is important that your tires have the<strong> pressure indicated</strong> by the manufacturer, both to have minimal fuel consumption as well as for security, to preserve the tires in optimal conditions with minimal wear. To know the recommended pressure for your tires you can read our <a class=\"\" href=\"/abarth/grande-punto/guides/tire-pressure\">\n                <span class=\"\">tire pressure guide.</span>\n              </a></li><li><strong>Rolled down car windows</strong>: if the windows are rolled down the aerodynamics of the car will be reduced and aerodynamics play an important role when going at <strong>more than 45 mph</strong>, when air resistance increases considerably.</li><li> <strong>Electrical consumption</strong>: it may be caused because <strong>more lights </strong>were added or because the <strong>sound</strong> system was upgraded to a more powerful one. This consumes more of the battery's electricity, which at the same time will need more of the alternator's supply, which will eventually consume more of the engine's power.</li></ol><h2>Issues of your Grande Punto which increase fuel consumption</h2><ul><li><strong>Tight brakes</strong>: If you feel that your car subtly brakes all the time, you should take it to a mechanic so that they can <strong>clean and adjust the brakes</strong>. If you don't do this, you will accelerate more than you want just to maintain a specific speed.</li><li><strong>Defective battery</strong>: a defective battery lowers its efficiency and makes it require more electrical power from the alternator (which, in turn, consumes more of the engine's power).</li><li><strong>Clogged up air filter</strong>: this decreases combustion efficiency and more fuel is required to achieve the same power.</li><li><strong>Damaged spark plugs and/or spark plugs' wires</strong>: the spark of the spark plugs is weaker than usual and the fuel burns in an incomplete manner, for which reason more fuel is needed to achieve the same power (or speed).</li><li><strong>Defective ignition coil</strong>: this is just like the previous item, but you should notice this problem when you drive, as the engine works in a “mismatched” manner; you can feel vibrations, your car suddenly stops or it jerks when you accelerate or drive at a constant speed.</li><li><strong>Leaks in the fuel circuit</strong>: You can identify them if you perceive a constant gasoline <strong>smell</strong>.</li><li><strong>Dirty or damaged injectors</strong>: they may lead to the leak of small quantities of fuel when it is not necessary, even with the engine stopped. This may also damage the exhaust system of the engine as the waste is accumulated.</li><li><strong>Dirty or damaged fuel filter</strong>: it allows the filth to go through, which damages the injectors.</li><li><strong>Faulty oxygen sensor (Lambda probe)</strong>: it indicates incorrect oxygen values which makes the air and the fuel mix inadequately and this increases fuel consumption.</li><li> <strong>Faulty mass air flow sensor</strong>: this electronic management system has no way of knowing clearly how much air is actually going inside the engine, and for this reason this mixture becomes inefficient, as well as the combustion.</li></ul><p>You can check fuel consumption by paying attention to the <strong><em>instantaneous consumption</em></strong> and the <strong><em>average consumption</em></strong>, which can be verified in cars with an on-board computer. The first one will give you a reference to evaluate in which cases your car consumes the lowest amount of fuel so as to repeat these scenarios, and the second one will give you a value to compare with the values of other users to check if your car’s fuel consumption is average or if your car has <strong>any of the problems mentioned</strong> in the previous section.</p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\"> <strong>✔️</strong> <strong>Recommendations if you want to buy a car with good fuel economy:</strong><br><br><strong>1 - </strong>Choose small cars with small engines.<br><strong>2 - </strong>It is important that these cars do not have a “square” shape, their body should be more aerodynamic.<br><strong>3 - </strong>Look up information about fuel consumption declared by their manufacturers and other users so that you can compare them.</p>",

This system works thanks to certain sensors placed strategically in the bodywork of the car and they are controlled by certain electronic modules. If there is a collision, the car will determine how strong it is and which airbags should be deployed.</p><p>As this system is usually very complex, if you notice any anomaly or if you see a warning light indicating that something is damaged, you should take your car to a specialist as soon as you can. Since these airbags are so important for both your and the other passengers’ safety, you should always have an expert deal with them.</p><h2>When do the airbags get activated in your Grande Punto?</h2><p>When the <strong>car sensors</strong> sense a collision, they send a signal to the car’s <strong>computer</strong>. If the computer decides that the collision is strong enough, it deploys the airbags to protect the people in the car.</p><p>Moments after they have been deployed, the airbags begin to deflate to cushion the collision of the body. This whole cycle happens at a great speed in hundredths of a second.</p><p>Once the airbags have been deployed, they are no longer useful; a specialist should replace them with new ones.</p><h2><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/airbags_externos.jpg\"></div></h2>"

Almost all of them work in the same way: the fluid goes through one or more sheets of porous paper in which these impurities are caught.</p><p><strong>⚠️ There is one main problem with filters:</strong></p><p>As time goes on, particles are accumulated in the filters and <strong>overload</strong> them, so the fluids (either fuel, air, or oil) cannot flow through them anymore. When this happens, we say that <strong>the filter is “clogged.”</strong></p><h2>When should you change the filters of your Punto Evo?</h2><ul><li><strong>Air filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> They must usually be replaced every <strong>7,000 miles.</strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_aire_admision.jpg\"></div>Purpose: they purify the air that gets into the cylinders. It catches any impurities that may be in the air, such as dirt, sand, plant remains, bugs, etc. It is essential to keep the internal surfaces of both cylinders and piston rings clean, which also diminishes their wear.  It is found inside the engine compartment, inside of a plastic black box (air cleaner case).</li><li><strong>Fuel filter</strong>:   <strong></strong>Fuel filters should be replaced <strong>every 10,000 miles or once a year</strong>. Diesel filters usually last longer, so it is advisable to change them after <strong>30,000 miles</strong>. <strong></strong><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_de_combustible.png\"></div>Purpose: it catches all the impurities in the fuel that may come from the fuel tank. It prevents the injectors, as well as some other parts of the fuel feed system, from getting dirty. In Diesel cars, they also catch the water that may be in the fuel.This filter is usually close to the fuel tank in gasoline cars, and you can access it right under it. On the other hand, in Diesel cars, this filter is placed inside the engine compartment.</li><li><strong>Motor oil filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> They must usually be replaced <strong>every 5,000 - 10,000 miles (when you change the oil).</strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_aceite.jpg\"></div>Purpose: one of the purposes of the motor oil is to clean the engine and prevent dirt from sticking into metallic surfaces. The dirt transported by the oil is caught in the filter to prevent it from flowing into the engine. It also catches any metallic pieces that come from the engine wear. It is essential to keep the wear of all the internal parts of the engine to a minimum. It is attached to the engine block (monobloc), in front or next to the engine.</li><li><strong>Transmission fluid filter</strong>:   <strong></strong> Replace it or at least clean it every time you change the transmission fluid. In <strong>automatic cars</strong>, change it every <strong>25,000 miles</strong>, and in <strong>manual cars</strong> every <strong>50,000 miles</strong>.<strong></strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_transmision_aut.jpg\"></div> Purpose: They are commonly found in automatic transmission cars, since they catch any impurities created in them, preventing the wear and keeping the transmission working properly. They are located inside the transmission.</li><li><strong>Cabin air filter (or pollen filter)</strong>:   <strong></strong> They must usually be replaced every <strong>6,000 - 20,000 miles</strong>, depending on how dirty they are<strong>.</strong> <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/filtro_de_habitaculo.jpg\"></div>Purpose: they catch any impurities brought by the air that enters the cabin due to the air conditioner. It stops dust and pollen particles, bugs, and plant remains. They are not really necessary for the car to work correctly, but they help the passengers feel more comfortable. They are placed inside of the ventilation duct, on the passenger seat’s side.</li></ul><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">⚠️ <strong>Warning</strong>: sometimes, the <strong>change periods vary a lot</strong> depending on how much dirt these filters have accumulated. For example, if you drive in areas where there is a lot of dust in the air, you will have to change the air and cabin filters more frequently than if you drive in a city. The same happens with fuel filters: if the fuel you use is not of good quality, it would be better to change it more frequently.</p><p>We have stated the standard periods to change these filters, but you should always change them according to the periods stated in your  Punto Evo‘s  <a href=\"/abarth/punto-evo/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.</p><p>Please take into account that some filters are more important than others since they have an impact on the way the car works, but all of them <strong>should be checked periodically</strong> by you or by a specialist.</p>",

                        "<h2>What is the oxygen sensor (or lambda sensor) of your Punto Evo?</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In short:<br></strong>The oxygen sensor, also known as the <strong>lambda sensor</strong>, is in the exhaust system and <strong>measures the oxygen level in the exhaust gases</strong>. This information is later used by the central computer of your Punto Evo (ECU or PCM) to control the fuel injection and allow the engine to work efficiently without wasting fuel or reducing its efficiency.</p><p>The exhaust system may have 1 or 2 oxygen sensors. The main one is in the inlet of the catalytic converter, and it monitors the gases that come out of the engine. The second one (if your car has one) is in the catalytic converter outlet, and its purpose is to monitor its performance. It is important to remember that if the catalytic converter malfunctions, extremely pollutant gases will be released into the atmosphere. The oxygen sensor usually begins to fail after the car has driven from <strong>55,000 to 90,000 miles (90,000 to 140,000 km), </strong>and that is when you should replace it. If it is working correctly, you do not have to replace it. Take into account that this is not an essential component with set maintenance periods, even if it helps your Punto Evo work efficiently by reducing its emissions, and it also helps extend the engine lifespan. <strong>The oxygen sensor usually malfunctions when a lot of dirt has been accumulated </strong>due to the wrong fuel type or low-quality fuel usage. <strong>Most of the time </strong>you just need to clean it for it to go back to normal.</p><h2>Signs that show that your Punto Evo‘s oxygen sensor is faulty</h2><p>You will usually notice that the oxygen sensor is faulty when the <strong>idle speed is unstable</strong>, there is increased fuel consumption, and the <strong>check engine light</strong> comes on (you can see this light below). </p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/testigo_check_engine.png\"></div><p></p>",

This sensor is small, and its parts are immovable. It has a small hose that is placed in a hole that leads to the inside of the air circuit.</p><p>To function, the engine always tries to draw air in, but the butterfly valve blocks it partially. This creates a depression (a “negative” pressure) inside the intake manifold. It is like sucking the air in an empty plastic bottle. The faster the engine spins, and/or, the tighter this butterfly valve is closed, the bigger this depression will get. With this and some other pieces of information, the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) estimates the engine load (the burden placed on the engine) and adjusts the fuel injection to keep its optimal performance and minimize its fuel consumption.</p><h2>Signs that show that your Punto Evo‘s MAP sensor is faulty</h2><ul><li>The <em>Check engine</em> light comes on</li><li>Erratic speed: sometimes you cannot speed up, the acceleration may be slow, or your car may decelerate</li><li>Increased smoke emissions</li></ul><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️ <strong>Some other problems may cause symptoms similar to those of a faulty MAP sensor</strong>, for example, vacuum leaks.

Some vehicles also include a similar sensor in the accelerator pedal called “APP sensor”.<br>The TPS sensor is located in the throttle body. If your vehicle has an automatic transmission, the TPS sensor also influences the control of the gears.</p><h2>Signs that show that your Punto Evo‘s TPS is faulty</h2><ul><li>Unstable idle speed</li><li>Lack of power</li><li>The car stalls or jerks</li><li>The “check engine” light comes on</li><li>In automatic cars, the gears may not work properly</li></ul>",

In this case, it should be replaced.</li><li><strong>Worn-out piston rings: </strong>if these rings are worn-out, there will be excessive oil consumption which may be accompanied by white or gray smoke. Worn-out piston rings may also be identified by the slow acceleration of your Punto Evo.</li><li><strong>Wrong motor oil: </strong>if the oil that you use for your Punto Evo has a<strong> lower viscosity</strong> than the required one, there might be <strong>leaks</strong> and the oil may drip into the piston rings and the valve seals. If the oil is <strong>too thick</strong>, the oil flow will decrease while its <strong>pressure will be higher than it should.</strong> This may lead to engine failures.

If the problem is serious, your Punto Evo will be in a “emergency” state that will prevent you from accelerating the engine above certain speed limit, forcing you to drive at low speed in order to avoid further damages. </strong></p><p>The check engine light can alert you about some failures but not all of them. It will depend on how complex the electronic control unit of your Punto Evo is.</p><p>To properly diagnose the failure of your Punto Evo, it is important <strong>to have a suitable scanner</strong> that is compatible with the brand and model of your car. The scanner will show <strong>the engine fault code </strong>that the computer has detected, which is related to a certain problem that is affecting the engine.</p><h2>The most common check engine light causes of your Punto Evo and how to detect them</h2><ul><li>Ignition cylinder problems: irregular engine running.</li><li>Problem with exhaust gas oxygen sensor (Lambda probe): irregular engine running, there are misfires when accelerating abruptly or driving at low revs. It may be caused by a sensor fault or a failure of the catalytic converter.</li><li>Problems with the engine intake (air or fuel): engine running may be rough or irregular.</li><li>Problems with the electrical system: sometimes it is easy to identify the cause but other times it may take days of testing to find the source of the problem. </li><li>Sensor malfunction: It affects engine running or stops running completely. </li><li>Wiring problems: contact failure, cut wires, short circuits.</li></ul><h2>Indicator status and severity</h2><p>The check engine light can behave in different ways. Here we show you the most common light signals so you can know what is happening to your Punto Evo:</p><ul><li><strong>The light turns on when you switch on the ignition key and then it turns off</strong>: It’s normal. It’s used to verify that the light itself is working and the bulb is not burned out.</li><li><strong>The light blinks and then it turns off (cyclically)</strong>: This indicates that the car had a problem at one point but it is not happening at the moment.</li><li><strong>The light is steady:</strong> This indicates that there is a problem but is not so serious as to stop driving your vehicle.</li><li><strong>The light blinks continuously:</strong> This indicates that there is a critical problem. Usually, you should stop driving your vehicle. </li></ul><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">Keep in mind that if you have a <strong>top-quality scanner, you will be able to verify all the car sensors</strong>, avoiding blind maintenance which is a pointless waste of money.

And even if you can repair it, the cost will be extremely high.<br></p><p>This oil also “softens” friction between the different movable pieces of your car’s engine. It eliminates any direct contact between two surfaces in movement by creating a fluid layer among them. If this oil did not exist, these pieces would get worn out faster, and there would be so much heat created that the metals would melt and stick to each other, which would produce a lot of damage, most of it irreversible. This phenomenon is known as metal seizure.<br></p><p>Generally, good lubrication <strong>reduces engine wear and noise, and saves energy </strong>because of the diminished friction between different moving parts,<strong> and reduces maintenance costs.</strong><br></p><p>Their additives also have different roles, and they generally can be found altogether in motor oils:<br></p><ul><li><strong>They inhibit corrosion </strong>and prevent the engine from <strong>getting rusty</strong><br></li><li>They are dispersant: they <strong>prevent</strong> the dirt from forming any <strong>lumps,</strong> which may block any holes or become abrasive<br></li><li>They have a cleaning function: they <strong>clean</strong> the surfaces<br></li><li>They are <strong>defoamers</strong>: they prevent any air bubbles from creating<br></li><li>Their <strong>anti-friction</strong> properties reduce the friction between pieces even more<br></li><li>They work as <strong>antioxidants</strong>: they avoid the deterioration of the oil itself<br></li><li>They enhance viscosity: they allow the <strong>viscosity levels to stay high even at high temperatures</strong><br></li></ul>",

You will find the rest of specifications such as <strong>viscosity and quality</strong> in the <a href=\"/abarth/punto-evo/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> of your Punto Evo.</p><h2>What is oil viscosity and which is better for your Punto Evo?</h2><p>Viscosity is a <strong>measure of an oil’s resistance to flow</strong>: The thicker (higher viscosity) the oil, the slower it will flow and it will take more time to reach every part of the engine. It is commonly said that the oil is \"heavier\" when it is more viscous and \"lighter\" in the opposite case. Viscosity grades are measured based on SAE standards. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p>We advise you to look for the recommended viscosity in your <a href=\"/abarth/punto-evo/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> or ask your trusted mechanic. If you can’t find the information and you have to change the engine oil, this is what you have to know: </p><p>When engines work at low temperatures (engine start), the oil should be more fluid in order to reach every part of the engine and ensure immediate lubrication. After a few minutes, the temperature of the engine will rise and, ideally, the oil viscosity should be higher. This ensures proper lubrication without breaking the lubricant film. Nowadays, all oils meet this requirement and they are called <strong>multigrade oils </strong>(lower viscosity at cold temperatures and higher viscosity at hot temperatures).</p><p><strong>A medium viscosity level would be the SAE 10W-40 engine oil</strong>, which meet the needs of the current car models without difficulty.</p><p>If you live in a place where the temperature drops to 14° F (-10° C) or less you should use an oil with lower viscosity (5W-40 for example).<strong></strong></p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\"> ⚠️ If your vehicle has over 124,000 mi and consumes oil or you see some white smoke coming from the exhaust pipe, you can use an oil with a slightly higher viscosity to compensate for wear. </p><h2>Which engine oil should your Punto Evo use?</h2><p><strong></strong>You can find the specific engine oil quality for your Punto Evo in <strong>the Maintenance section </strong>of your <a href=\"/abarth/punto-evo/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.

They both use anchors specifically designed, which are located in the car seats. Two of these anchors are placed in the seat base, and the other one is on top, called top tether.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/adeff0ae_Capture.PNG\"></div><p></p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/a805de99_Capture2.JPG\"></div><p></p><p>ISOFIX and LATCH are very similar.

                        "<h2> Exhaust smoke and its colors on a Punto Evo: causes and severity</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In a few words:</strong><br>According to the color of the exhaust smoke that is released from the exhaust pipe of your Punto Evo you will be able to identify the possible causes. The colors of the exhaust smoke that your Punto Evo may produce will help you find the problem. In <strong>order of priority </strong>from the least to the most dangerous, these colors are:<strong> white, blue, black, mix of two colors</strong>.</p><p>First, it should be said that the exhaust gas that is usually released through the exhaust pipe of your car is basically <strong>invisible</strong>. You should see a faint and short-lived exhaust that fades shortly after appearing only if you speed up abruptly. If your Punto Evo discharges visible exhaust smoke then it is very likely that you need to take it to a specialist.</p><h2>White exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a Punto Evo</h2><p>The exhaust gas that comes out without strength and elevates considerably (it may get over the roof) but then fades without any trace when your car is idling may only be <strong>water vapor.</strong> This exhaust does not smell like anything in particular and it can be seen if the temperature is low or if there is humidity. <strong>If this is the case, do not worry.</strong></p><p><strong>If the white exhaust smoke does not fade, it is dense and smells, then</strong> it is associated with a <strong>coolant leak</strong>. In this case, the <strong>coolant level</strong> of your Punto Evo <strong>should be low</strong>. Have your car checked up by a specialist to confirm this leak and prevent your engine from overheating.</p><p>⚠️<strong> Check the recovery tank. </strong>If you see that the <strong>coolant is bubbling</strong> that means that it is leaking into the combustion chamber. This is caused by a leak of exhaust gases into the cooling system. If your car has these symptoms <strong>you should</strong> <strong>have your engine checked</strong> by a specialist at once since this malfunction may bring serious problems.</p><p>This liquid leak may be caused by the following reasons:</p><ul><li>The cylinder head gasket is damaged (which is the cheapest problem to fix)</li><li>The cylinder head or the engine block are cracked (which is more expensive)</li></ul><h2>Blue exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a Punto Evo</h2><p>At first sight this exhaust smoke seems white but it has a <strong>blueish tone, a certain density and a particular smell, like something is burning. </strong>Moreover, its <strong>volume increases significantly when you step on the accelerator.</strong></p><p>This blue exhaust smoke indicates that the <strong>lubricant oil is burning</strong>, either because there is a leak into the inside of the combustion chamber or a leak into the exhaust system.</p><p>⚠️ <strong>Check if the level of lubricant oil</strong> of your Punto Evo <strong>is decreasing drastically</strong> to verify if that is the cause.</p><p>The causes for this lubricant leak are usually the following:</p><ul><li><strong>The valve stem seals are in a bad shape</strong></li><li>The <strong>piston rings are worn down</strong></li><li>Leaks of oil in the supercharger (if the engine of you Punto Evo has this system)</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, fixing any of these problems is expensive and they usually affect<strong> high mileage engines</strong> (with more than 90,000 miles) or cars with <strong>badly battered engines</strong>.</p><p><strong>If the exhaust smoke is blue but it is not too dense</strong>, it may be caused by a blockage in the crankcase ventilation system.</p><p>⚠️ In this case, <strong>the exhaust smoke will come from the engine and not from the exhaust pipe</strong>.</p><p>It is normal to see blueish exhaust coming from the exhaust pipe of mopeds and motorbikes with a two-stroke engine, and, in those cases, this exhaust is not caused by a failure.</p><h2>Black exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a Punto Evo</h2><p>This problem <strong>is usually seen in diesel engines</strong> and it is caused by a <strong>great increase in the amount of fuel supplied to the engine</strong>, that is to say, the engine is burning more fuel than it should.</p><p>⚠️ Check if the <strong>consumption of fuel</strong> of your Punto Evo <strong>has increased significantly</strong>.<strong> You should also notice</strong> this because of <strong>the reduction of power </strong>of the engine.</p><p>You can also verify this flaw by <strong>putting a white cloth inside the exhaust pipe, clogging it up for a few seconds</strong>. This cloth will <strong>turn black</strong> instantly due to the expelled coal particles.</p><p>This black color is caused by the generation of hydrocarbons that are not completely burnt. They create more <strong>carbonaceous particles</strong> which soil the lubricant oil and they settle in each nook and cranny of the engine of your Punto Evo. At the same time, they are also accumulated inside the combustion chamber as hard crusts that are abrasive and wear down movable pieces.</p><p>The exhaust system is also affected because of the accumulation of cinder, which also poses a threat to the catalytic converter, the particle filter or the muffler of the car.</p><p>This problem may be caused by any of the following items:</p><ul><li>The air filter is too dirty.</li><li>The fuel injectors, the fuel pressure regulator, the throttle position sensor (TPS), or the Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor are dirty or there is an electrical flaw in them.</li><li>The Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valve is malfunctioning (this valve recirculates the exhaust gases back to the engine). When you accelerate, this EGR valve remains open so that the exhaust gases can get inside the engine once again.</li></ul><h2>Two-colored exhaust smoke coming from the exhaust pipe on a Punto Evo</h2><p>In the worst case scenario the released exhaust will be two-colored. This means that there are many simultaneous causes for this problem and it is important that a specialist investigates this as soon as possible to prevent further failures.</p>",
                        "<h2>What do the technical specifications of your Punto Evo’s engine mean?</h2><p>Even though all engines are very similar when you look at them, there are many different types. We will now show you what the most usual technical specifications that you can find in the <strong>technical datasheet</strong> of your <strong> Punto Evo </strong>mean.</p><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Gasoline or Diesel engines</strong><br><br>This is the main difference between engines. Engines that need Diesel have incandescent spark plugs that only work when the car starts. Once the engine is running, the fuel ignites by itself since it is compressed inside the cylinders thanks to the high temperature it reaches.<br>On the other hand, gasoline engines work thanks to the spark constantly created by the spark plugs. This means that they work all the time the engine is running.<br>Another difference between these two engines is that Diesel engines are generally heavier, and their structure is more robust.</li><li><strong>Number of cylinders</strong><br><br>It is the <strong>number</strong> of cylinders inside the engine. <strong>The engine power is generated </strong>in the cylinders because that is where the pistons are. For this reason, the more cylinders the engine has, the more its power will be. This also means that the engine will be bigger and heavier. It is also important to notice that if there are a lot of cylinders, the engine will consume more fuel. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/bloque.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Bore/stroke ratio</strong><br><br><strong>These are the piston’s measurements, </strong>and they can be expressed in centimeters or inches. They indicate the cylinder diameter (bore) and the longitudinal displacement (stroke) that the piston does inside the cylinder when the engine is running. These measurements allow us to measure the “displaced volume” by the piston. <strong>If the diameter is wide and the piston has a short stroke, the engine will be fit for sports cars.</strong> In other words, the revolutions per minute (RPMs) will be high.  <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/cf9931c1_carrera y diametro.png\"></div></li><li><strong>Engine displacement</strong><br><br>It is the total available volume in the engine cylinders. It is calculated by multiplying the stroke length, the bore, and the number of cylinders.<br>Depending on the country, it may be expressed in liters (1.6 L, 2.0 L, 3.6 L), or in cubic inches (98, 110, 250, 510 CI).<br>Generally, <strong>the higher the engine displacement is, the more power your car will have, but the higher its fuel consumption will be.</strong></li><li><strong>Cylinder arrangement</strong><br><br>a) In-line arrangement: nowadays, it is hard to find engines with more than 6 in-line cylinders because they take up too much space under the hood.<br><br>b) V-type arrangement: They are more compact and create fewer vibrations, but they can only be used with an even number of cylinders (V6, V8, V10, etc.).<br><br>c) Opposed arrangement: they are flat and not frequently used because their manufacture and maintenance are very demanding. Moreover, like the V-type arrangement, they can only be used with an even number of cylinders. <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/tipo_de_motor.jpg\"></div></li><li><strong>Valvetrain type: SOHC and DOHC</strong><br><br>a) SOHC (single overhead camshaft):  It only has one camshaft placed in the cylinder head. Only one camshaft controls all the engine’s valves. They generally have more power if there are low RPMs. The camshaft is in charge of opening and closing the engine’s valves.<br>b) DOHC (double overhead camshaft): It has two camshafts placed in the cylinder head. One camshaft controls the admission valve while the other controls the escape valve. The performance of these engines is usually better if the RPMs are high. Moreover, its parts are usually lighter and can move faster.</li><li><strong>Compression ratio</strong><br><br><strong>It is the measurement of how much the volume of the air-fuel mixture can be compressed inside of the cylinder.</strong> The higher this number is, the higher the engine power will be. For example, if there is an 8:1 ratio, this means that the mixture will be reduced to one octave of its original volume.<br>Generally, compression ratios are between 8:1 and 12:1 for gasoline engines.</li><li><strong>Naturally aspirated or turbo engines</strong><br><br>A <strong>naturally aspired</strong> engine means <strong>that the engine draws air directly through an air intake.</strong> In turbocharged cars, on the other hand,<strong> the turbocharger injects air by forcing it into the engine.</strong> The advantage of using turbochargers is that, in small engines, the power increases because it is possible to inject more air and fuel into the cylinders.</li><li><strong> Torque</strong><br><br><strong>It is the “strength” that the engine has when it accelerates.</strong><br>It is measured in “foot-pounds” or in “N.m” (1 N.m = 0.737 ft.lb), and to express it, the RPM of the engine must also be stated. For example: 150 N.m @ 1700 RPM.<br>Off-road cars usually have a lot of torque and not so much power. This enables them to drive up big slopes at a slow speed or dodge big pits and rocks. Diesel engines have more torque than gasoline engines.</li><li><strong> Power</strong><br><br><strong>It is the car’s ability to accelerate (to react) at high speeds.</strong><br>It is measured in HP (Horse Power), or in KW (1 HP = 0.745 KW).</li><li><strong> Revolutions per minute (RPM)</strong><br><br><strong>They represent the engine speed. It is important to distinguish them from the car speed since they are not the same thing.</strong> Both are related by the transmission. For example, if the car is in neutral gear and we press the accelerator, we may only change the engine speed but not the car speed.<br>Technically speaking: <em>Torque x RPM = Power</em><br>In a car, the RPM are controlled by the accelerator. Their rise depends on how much we press the accelerator, and this will be reflected in the tachometer. The higher the RPMs are, the noisier the engine will be.</li></ol>",

They are cheap, disposable and there are <strong>different types</strong> according to their usage and the amount of <strong>amperage</strong> they transmit.<br>There are Bosch fuses (or torpedo or GCB), cylinder fuses (or cartridge) made of glass, blade (or spade) fuses, cartridge fuses (JSCASE and MCASE), and high current fuses. The same car may have up to 3 types of fuses for its different circuits.</p><p>Fuses are pieces that <strong>protect the electrical circuits</strong>. That is to say, every time an electrical component of your Punto Evo <strong>suddenly stops working</strong>, there might be a <strong>blown fuse</strong>. The good news is that fuses are really <strong>cheap and easy to replace</strong>. For this reason, before you mourn the loss of your stereo, air conditioner, or other devices, you should first check these little pieces.</p><p>All of them work in the same way and, the other good news is that they have no front or backside, so they are <strong>easy to put into place</strong>. Despite their small size, they have a <strong>calibrated conductor for the highest current they can withstand</strong>, and if the current goes over this value, the conductor breaks, which interrupts the circuit and makes it impossible for the current to keep on flowing.

                        "<h2>How to keep your Punto Evo safe during extended periods without use</h2><p>If your Punto Evo has to stay in one place for a long time, here are some recommendations to keep your car in the best possible condition.</p><p><strong>Battery:</strong> Disconnect the negative terminal of the battery. This will prevent the electrical components from consuming it, and it will prevent any future problems when you start your Punto Evo.</p><p><strong>Tires: </strong>Inflate your car’s tires with more pressure than the recommended one for driving. Either 3 or 4 psi should be enough. Like this, they will not get deformed when they naturally deflate.</p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">If you will not use your Punto Evo for a few months, you can also create some sort of support with bricks (or any other elements) and place it under the chassis so that it can help the wheels hold the weight of the car when the wheels deflate.</p><p><strong>Fuel:</strong> Ideally, the fuel tank should be full. If there is less air inside of the tank, there is less probability of it evaporating. Additionally, like this, if the tank is metallic, you will prevent its rusting.</p><p><strong>Hand brake:</strong> You must never activate it unless it is really necessary. It has a wire in its mechanism, and if this wire stays taut for a long period, it may get damaged. Also the brake pad (brake shoe) may get stuck or corrode the pieces it is in contact with.</p><p><strong>Fluids and oils:</strong> Check that the levels of refrigerant, steering fluid, brake fluid, and oil of your Punto Evo are the recommended ones.</p><p><strong>Start:</strong> If you can, start your Punto Evo once every ten days. This will prevent the wear of the mechanical pieces of the engine, and it will recharge the battery. During those moments, you should also turn the air conditioner on, move the automatic windows and turn all the lights on and off. The movement of the circuits will keep your car in good shape.</p><p><strong>Exhaust pipe: </strong>Put a small cloth with motor oil in the external part of the exhaust pipe to prevent corrosion.</p><p><strong>Cleaning: </strong>Prevent bad smells and mold in the car by cleaning the inside of the car thoroughly. You may also leave some carbon or a cup with dry rice inside so that they will absorb humidity.</p><p>To keep the outside of the car clean, you can wax your car and then cover it with a car tarpaulin.</p><p></p>",
                        "<h2>What light bulbs fit your Punto Evo?</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In short:</strong><br>If one of your Punto Evo‘s bulbs burned out and you want to know which one you should buy to replace it, you can remove it and take it to an auto part store, or you can check the maintenance section found in the <a href=\"/abarth/punto-evo/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>.<br>If you replaced the bulb but it is still not working, you should check the fuses.</p><p>Your Punto Evo has bulbs that illuminate both the outside and the inside of the car. Since headlamps are more complex, there are many types. They are the ones that illuminate the road ahead without dazzling the other drivers. Brake lights are only there to be seen at a sensible distance by the drivers behind you, and their purpose is to light up when you press the brake pedal.</p><p><strong>Generally, changing these bulbs is easy,</strong> and you can do it yourself. Cars have a different lighting system from that of a house since they are guaranteed to keep working despite the vehicle’s vibrations. You only have to make sure that their <strong>pigtail wire has been properly connected</strong>. You will know they have been connected properly because <strong>there is only one way they can be connected</strong>.</p><p>You should <strong>have a spare bulb in your Punto Evo</strong> if you are about to go on a road trip. Even if <strong>a bulb has a lifespan of several years</strong>, they are cheap and it never hurts to be careful.</p><ul><li><strong>LED lamps</strong></li></ul><p>The main advantage of LED lamps is their <strong>efficiency</strong>: they produce <strong>a lot of light,</strong> and they <strong>draw less electrical energy (</strong>up to 80% less<strong>)</strong>. Moreover, their <strong>lifespan is 25 times longer</strong> than the lifespan of a halogen lamp. LED lamps are <strong>instantly on</strong> and, since the component that produces light is relatively small, these lamps can be created in any shape or form. They are made of semiconductor materials enclosed in a small, plastic shell and only one lamp may produce different colors.</p><p>There are a lot of high-end brands that use LED technology for their products, but their usage of fixed LED light panels makes it almost impossible for them to be changed without having to visit an authorized car dealer.</p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/0af84ef3_Untitled4-628x280.png\"></div><p></p><ul><li><strong>Incandescent lamps</strong></li></ul><p>They are the <strong>oldest ones, they consume a lot of energy and create a lot of heat.</strong> They are made up of a metallic filament which is protected by a transparent glass bulb. When the electricity goes through the filament, it turns bright red and it produces light. Nowadays, these lamps are still used to illuminate <strong>car interiors, dashboard lights, brake lights, direction-indicator lights, and front position lights</strong>, since these lights do not need to be too powerful. They have different watts, sizes, and shapes according to their usage. They may have 1 or 2 filaments (just like the brake lights).</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/e7ba5170_Incandenscentes.jpg\"></div><p></p><ul><li><strong>Halogen lamps</strong></li></ul><p><strong>They are the enhanced version of incandescent lamps.</strong> <strong>The light they produce is stronger and whiter.</strong> They work the same way; the only difference is that the glass bulb encloses halogen gas, which improves the filament’s output and, therefore, also enhances its lifespan. For these reasons, these lamps are more efficient, and small halogen lamps may be powerful.</p><p>These lamps may have <strong>different</strong> amounts of filaments, their filaments may be placed in different positions, and the shape of their bulbs may be different. The most common ones are these: </p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/412a152f_Halógenas2.jpg\"></div><p></p><p><strong>H1 lamps</strong>: <strong>They are used in fog lamps and high beam lights.</strong> They only have one filament placed longitudinally and they have a compact shape. There are 55, 70 and, 100-W H1 lamps.</p><p><strong>H3 lamps</strong>: They are usually used in <strong>fog lamps and long-range lights</strong>, and they have only one filament, which is placed transversely. They are the most compact ones. They only include a small wire to connect them. There are 55, 70 and 100-W H3 lamps.</p><p><strong>H4 lamps</strong>: They are the most used in <strong>headlamps because they can also be used as dipped beam headlights and high beam lights, which saves space.</strong> They have two filaments, and they are bigger than the other types of lamps. There are usually 55/60, 70/75, and 90/100-W H4 lamps (for crossings/highways).</p><p><strong>H7 lamps</strong>: They are mainly used in <strong>fog lamps</strong>. They only have one linear filament, and they are somewhat bigger than H1 and H3 lamps.</p><ul><li><strong>Xenon lamps</strong></li></ul><p><strong>They are the brightest ones,</strong> and the light they produce is whiter than the one made by halogen lamps. Their downside is that the electrical energy needed to turn these lamps on must be high (30,000 V). Their arc needs a high current, so they need auxiliary equipment called reactance, which is in charge of controlling the electrical energy of the lamp. If you are thinking of switching to Xenon’s lamps, an auto mechanic should do it for you.</p><p><strong>These lights take one minute to reach their maximum power.</strong> The good thing is that once you turn these lights on, they <strong>consume less electricity than halogen lamps</strong>, <strong>generate less heat and their lifespan is way longer.</strong> They are <strong>more expensive</strong> than the other lamps.</p><p>Regarding their structure, they do not have filaments. They have two electrodes, separated by a few millimeters protected by a glass bulb where there is high-pressure Xenon gas. An electrical arc that produces light is created between these two electrodes. You can see this light in the following image.</p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/5f306ae3_xenon-lampara3.jpg\"></div><p></p>",

This happens inside of the cylinders, and the <strong>spark plugs</strong> are the ones that create it.</p><p>Spark plugs are only used in Otto cycle engines, which are usually called “gasoline” engines. This means that Diesel cars do not have spark plugs.</p><p>It is common for engines to have just one spark plug per cylinder. They are screwed into the lid, called cylinder head, and there is one part of them inside, and its connector is outside. They are connected to the ignition coil through a thick wire with a cap on its cover, as seen in the image below. </p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/cable_bujia.jpg\"></div><p></p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/bujia2.jpg\"></div><p></p><p>The ignition coil creates the high current necessary for the spark plug, which makes the spark that starts the fuel ignition process. In this way, the engine can start and speed up when needed.</p>",
                        "<h2>What kinds of spark plugs are there?</h2><p>There are many types of spark plugs, and their mechanic and electric characteristic vary a lot. All spark plugs are characterized by a specific code and its meaning is decided by their manufacturer.</p><p>This is a general review of their main characteristics so that you can identify them:</p><ul><li><strong>Diameter of the thread:</strong> 10 mm, 12 mm, or 14 mm</li><li><strong>Length of the thread:</strong> 0.460 inches, 12.7 mm, 0.708 inches, 19 mm, and 25 mm</li><li><strong>Hexagon size:</strong> it depends on the thread size. 5/8 inches, 18 mm, and 13/16 inches</li><li><strong>Seat: </strong>conical or flat <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/e2319e13_image.png\"></div></li><li><strong>Insulator length: </strong>the length between the thread and the end of the spark plug.</li><li><strong>Resistor spark plugs: </strong>they prevent any interferences between the electric system and the car.</li><li><strong>Electrode material: </strong>made of copper (the conventional type), Iridium, or Platinum. The last ones last longer and their spark is better.</li><li><strong>The number of electrodes</strong>: you can find spark plugs with 1, 2, 3, or 4 electrodes. When there are more electrodes, they deteriorate less.</li><li><strong>Heat rating: </strong>this value indicates how much heat the spark plug dissipates. If it does not dissipate a lot of heat, the fuel may self-ignite itself, and this will affect both the performance and the autonomy of the car. This number can be found in spark plugs under their brandmark<div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/c885ad6d_image.png\"></div></li><li><strong>Calibration: </strong>distance “d” between the central electrode and the earth electrode. If the separation is too small, the spark will also be small, and it will be hard to start the car. If it is too big, the spark may not be produced. You should always follow the calibration stated by the manufacturer.<div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/4aa75bf8_image.png\"></div></li></ul>",
                        "<h2>What kind of spark plugs does your Punto Evo need?</h2><p> You should always use the spark plugs recommended in the  <a href=\"/abarth/punto-evo/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> of your Punto Evo. If you need to replace them right away, you should buy the same type of spark plugs that your car had installed.<strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong> You should change the spark plugs after you have driven between<strong> 35,000 to 60,000 miles </strong>(60,000 to 100,000 km), depending on the type of spark plug, your driving style, and the quality of the fuel used. Ideally, you should check your spark plugs after driving<strong> 30,000 miles</strong> ( 50,000 km) to see their condition.<strong></strong></p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">⚠️ <strong>We advise you against using spark plugs different from the ones recommended </strong>by the manufacturer because every spark plug model has particular characteristics, and the engine of your Punto Evo has been optimized to function with those.</p><p>The owner’s manual will surely include specific spark plug brands, but you should know that there are <strong>cross-reference charts</strong> that include different <strong>brands</strong> and state the compatibility between the different types of spark plugs.

Sometimes, they are really tight. Do not let any <strong>dirt enter the cylinder holes</strong> from where you removed the spark plugs. If anything falls inside the cylinders, you will have to take it out no matter what, which will be a nuisance.</li><li>Put the new spark plugs in and turn the wrench clockwise. <strong>Tighten</strong> the spark plugs until they are all the way down, but <strong>do not over-tighten them</strong>.</li><li>Once they are down, <strong>you must use the wrench to secure them</strong> like this: tighten spark plugs with a flat seat (with a washer), an extra ½ of a turn, and spark plugs with a tapered seat an extra ⅛ of a turn. They must be tight but not <strong>overly tight.</strong> If they are over-tightened, the thread may break.  <div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/e2319e13_image.png\"></div></li><li>Reconnect the wires in the same order they were connected.</li></ol><p>And that is it.

                        "<h2>What is the right tire pressure for your Punto Evo?</h2><p>The tires’ pressure is very important both for the security and for the performance of our car.    </p><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"> <strong>⚠  There are 3 ways of checking which pressure is the recommended for your   Punto Evo: </strong> <br>1- ​In general terms, for street cars, SUVs and Pickups, the recommended pressure is  usually around <strong>​34 psi</strong>​. If your car is very loaded, you could go up to 38 psi without  problems. For sport cars (with very low profile tires), the usual thing to do  is to  inflate them to<strong> ​40 psi​. </strong><br><strong>2- ​Look up the recommendation in your  <a href=\"/abarth/punto-evo/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a></strong>.  <br><strong>3- Look up the tag in your car. </strong>​You can find it sticked in the internal frame of the  driver’s door, in the fuel-charger lid or in the sun shield. It will look like this one you  can see here:  <br></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/c2f52106_Caclo de presion generica.JPG\"></div> <br><p></p><h2>How should I interpret the chart of the tires’ pressure of my  Punto Evo? </h2><p>The tag with the recommended pressures varies according to the car’s  manufacturer. Here we show you an example where you will be able to see how to  interpret its data: </p><p></p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/etiqueta_neumaticos_2.PNG\"></div> <p></p><p>A - The columns on the right show the pressure of the back tires.  </p><p>B - The columns on the left show the pressure of the front tires. </p><p>C - If we read the  rows horizontally we will see that there is a recommended  pressure according to the load that our car will carry (represented in people and  luggage).  </p><p>D - The information that appears at the bottom is the recommended pressure for  your temporary auxiliary tire, which is not the same as the one recommended for the  rest of the tires, due to its smaller size. </p><p>E - The data ​T125/60​ and  R18 which appears in this example corresponds to the  measurements of the temporary auxiliary tire.  </p><p>Depending on the country of origin of your Punto Evo, the pressure of the tires  may be measured in  \"psi\" (commonly called “pounds”) in  \"bar\" or in “Kpa”.  That’s why in your car’s chart you can find any of them. Take  the machine that you will use for the measurements and <strong>check which unit it uses  and ​consider only that data in the tag​.</strong> The other data  will be the equivalent in other  units, so you don’t need to use it.</p><h2>When shall I check the pressure of the tires of my Punto Evo? </h2><p class=\"ArticleExtra\">⚠   <strong>We recommend you to check the pressure of the tires once every 15 days​</strong> and every time you are  about to start a long trip. You must do this measurement<strong> with ​cold tires for it to be precise. </strong>​Meaning,  don’t do it in the middle of a long journey because you will probably get a useless reading. Keep in mind that, while running, the tires get naturally deformed, by producing heat and absorbing the heat  from the road. The temperature rise makes ​the pressure to rise​ as well and then we might get higher values than we should in the measurement. </p><h2>Why is it important to respect the recommended pressure in your Punto Evo? </h2><p>The tires’ pressure was well studied by the manufacturers in order to guarantee: </p><ul><li> <strong>Security​: </strong>it improves the maneuverability and the stability and reduces the  braking. Also, it reduces the temperature of the tires, lessening the  chances of having punctures. </li><li> <strong>Fuel efficiency​: </strong>tires with the appropriate pressure generate less  resistance for the wheels and will therefore spend less fuel, contributing  both to saving money and with the environment.</li><li><strong> Reduces tire erosion: </strong>​the tires will be deformed less and will be less  mechanically demanded. In consequence, they will have longer life time. On top of this, the tire’s erosion will be even in the whole tire.<strong>Comfort​</strong>: you will feel that your car is more stable and will feel less the  potential irregularities of the road (because you will have better shock  absorbency). </li></ul><h2>Erosion according with the tire inflation level on a Punto Evo </h2><p>The correct tire inflation level ensures that the tires’ footprint is optimal. More or  less pressure will provoque undesired deformations. As a consequence, <strong>there will be  an​ uneven erosion ​and ​less adherence ​than the one needed​</strong>.</p><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/neumatico-desgaste.jpg\"></div><p></p><h2>Can I use a different pressure on my Punto Evo? </h2><p>You can use other pressure, but only in specific situations and knowing its possible  consequences: </p><ul><li> <strong>When you ride in sand​:</strong> lowering the pressure to 15 pounds will make  the tire’s track to widen and the tire to be in more contact with the field,  improving traction. Going back to a harder surface, you will need to  pump up the tires again for not damaging them.</li><li> <strong>To reduce fuel’s consumption:</strong> ​one can rise in 3 or 4 pounds the  pressure while circulating in a city. The other side of the coin of this tip is  that you will feel the irregularities of the road much more, you will have a worse ground attachment and you will have more erosion of the tire in its central area.  </li></ul><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠  An important recommendation: while  circulating in wet grounds​ (such as the ones you find on a rainy day), it is key to keep the adequate pressure, recommended by the manufacturer; because it will  guarantee you better adherence to the ground and therefore you will avoid accidents.  </p>",

The two of them are derived from petroleum, and they are formed by hydrocarbons (hydrogen and carbon molecules).</p><p class=\"ArticleWarning\">⚠️  <strong>The main rule is that you must only use diesel in Diesel engines and gasoline in spark-ignition engines </strong>(called “Otto cycle engines”).<strong> Otherwise, the engine of your Punto Evo may get ruined.</strong></p><p>To obtain energy from fuel, it must be burning: in a Diesel engine, the diesel burns because of the compression, and in an Otto cycle engine, it burns by a spark created by the spark plug. For this reason, each type of fuel has different characteristics: diesel is more oily and takes longer to burn, while gasoline is more volatile and burns a lot faster.</p><p>Diesel engines are more efficient than Otto engines, but their exhaust smoke is more contaminant. For this reason, they have to go through certain processes to comply with the pollution prevention laws, and that makes them more expensive.</p><p><strong>Natural gas </strong>is the third type of fuel, and it is mainly used in Latin-American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. To use it, many modifications should be made to the fuel system of the car, and a certified company should do it. This type of fuel makes the car have less autonomy than the other ones, so the engine’s performance may not be ideal, but since it is <strong>a lot cheaper</strong>, it is also popular.</p><p>There are two other types of fuel that are massively used: <strong>biodiesel </strong>and <strong>ethanol</strong> (ethylic alcohol). They are generally used as additives, the first one for Diesel fuel and the second one for gasoline.

                        "<h2> How to improve the fuel consumption of your Punto Evo</h2><p class=\"ArticleSummary\"><strong>In a few words:</strong><br>Fuel is the only <strong>source of energy</strong> that powers your Punto Evo, and consequently <strong>all the elements </strong>you might need <strong>that consume</strong> energy such as lights, music and air conditioning <strong>will impact</strong> directly on the amount of fuel used. If you decrease their usage you will see improved fuel economy. Another way of optimizing fuel consumption is by using the recommended type of fuel for your Punto Evo.</p><p><strong> </strong>To know the recommended fuel for your Punto Evo you can check the <a href=\"/abarth/punto-evo/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a>. <strong></strong></p><p><strong>It is important to use the recommended fuel so that the fuel consumption of your Punto Evo is optimal.</strong></p><h2>Common factors that affect the normal fuel consumption on a Punto Evo:</h2><ol type=\"1\"><li><strong>Driving manner: drive in a stable manner.</strong> Aggressive acceleration and braking will drastically increase fuel consumption since they require more engine power.</li><li><strong>If the car has a manual transmission, do not step on the clutch pedal as soon as you step on the brakes:</strong> cars with electronic fuel injection usually cut fuel supply when you stop stepping on the accelerator when the car is put in gear. Take advantage of the “engine braking” by letting the car stop on its own. In this way fuel consumption will decrease A LOT.</li><li><strong>Speed</strong>: the higher the speed, the greater the power needed. <strong>On highways, the optimal speed is of 60 mph with the car set in its highest gear.</strong> If we take into account the laws of physics, doubling the speed means increasing the power 8 times.</li><li><strong>Air conditioner</strong>: Always use the air conditioner in <strong>“recirculation” mode</strong>. Air conditioning consumes quite a lot of the engine's energy. Cooling the air inside the cabin is a lot easier than cooling the air coming from outside constantly. On the other hand, as the air conditioner compressor is usually mechanically connected to the engine, if there are more engine revolutions the energy consumption will increase.</li><li><strong>Tire pressure</strong>: it is important that your tires have the<strong> pressure indicated</strong> by the manufacturer, both to have minimal fuel consumption as well as for security, to preserve the tires in optimal conditions with minimal wear. To know the recommended pressure for your tires you can read our <a class=\"\" href=\"/abarth/punto-evo/guides/tire-pressure\">\n                <span class=\"\">tire pressure guide.</span>\n              </a></li><li><strong>Rolled down car windows</strong>: if the windows are rolled down the aerodynamics of the car will be reduced and aerodynamics play an important role when going at <strong>more than 45 mph</strong>, when air resistance increases considerably.</li><li> <strong>Electrical consumption</strong>: it may be caused because <strong>more lights </strong>were added or because the <strong>sound</strong> system was upgraded to a more powerful one. This consumes more of the battery's electricity, which at the same time will need more of the alternator's supply, which will eventually consume more of the engine's power.</li></ol><h2>Issues of your Punto Evo which increase fuel consumption</h2><ul><li><strong>Tight brakes</strong>: If you feel that your car subtly brakes all the time, you should take it to a mechanic so that they can <strong>clean and adjust the brakes</strong>. If you don't do this, you will accelerate more than you want just to maintain a specific speed.</li><li><strong>Defective battery</strong>: a defective battery lowers its efficiency and makes it require more electrical power from the alternator (which, in turn, consumes more of the engine's power).</li><li><strong>Clogged up air filter</strong>: this decreases combustion efficiency and more fuel is required to achieve the same power.</li><li><strong>Damaged spark plugs and/or spark plugs' wires</strong>: the spark of the spark plugs is weaker than usual and the fuel burns in an incomplete manner, for which reason more fuel is needed to achieve the same power (or speed).</li><li><strong>Defective ignition coil</strong>: this is just like the previous item, but you should notice this problem when you drive, as the engine works in a “mismatched” manner; you can feel vibrations, your car suddenly stops or it jerks when you accelerate or drive at a constant speed.</li><li><strong>Leaks in the fuel circuit</strong>: You can identify them if you perceive a constant gasoline <strong>smell</strong>.</li><li><strong>Dirty or damaged injectors</strong>: they may lead to the leak of small quantities of fuel when it is not necessary, even with the engine stopped. This may also damage the exhaust system of the engine as the waste is accumulated.</li><li><strong>Dirty or damaged fuel filter</strong>: it allows the filth to go through, which damages the injectors.</li><li><strong>Faulty oxygen sensor (Lambda probe)</strong>: it indicates incorrect oxygen values which makes the air and the fuel mix inadequately and this increases fuel consumption.</li><li> <strong>Faulty mass air flow sensor</strong>: this electronic management system has no way of knowing clearly how much air is actually going inside the engine, and for this reason this mixture becomes inefficient, as well as the combustion.</li></ul><p>You can check fuel consumption by paying attention to the <strong><em>instantaneous consumption</em></strong> and the <strong><em>average consumption</em></strong>, which can be verified in cars with an on-board computer. The first one will give you a reference to evaluate in which cases your car consumes the lowest amount of fuel so as to repeat these scenarios, and the second one will give you a value to compare with the values of other users to check if your car’s fuel consumption is average or if your car has <strong>any of the problems mentioned</strong> in the previous section.</p><p class=\"ArticleExtra\"> <strong>✔️</strong> <strong>Recommendations if you want to buy a car with good fuel economy:</strong><br><br><strong>1 - </strong>Choose small cars with small engines.<br><strong>2 - </strong>It is important that these cars do not have a “square” shape, their body should be more aerodynamic.<br><strong>3 - </strong>Look up information about fuel consumption declared by their manufacturers and other users so that you can compare them.</p>",

You can read the <a href=\"/abarth/punto-evo/info/manuals\">owner's manual</a> to know more about your car’s airbags.</p><p><strong>Internal airbags:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Front driver airbag: </strong>it protects the thorax and the head of the driver if there is a frontal collision. It is located in the middle of the steering wheel, and it is the most common one.</li><li><strong>Front passenger airbag: </strong>it is like the airbag for driver, but located inside of the glove box.</li><li><strong>Knee airbags: </strong>they protect the driver and the passenger from any leg and calf injuries. They are placed under the steering wheel and the glove box.</li><li><strong>Side airbags: </strong>they protect the passengers in case of side collisions by preventing their bodies from crashing into the car. They may be inside of the seats or inside of the bodywork.</li><li><strong>Curtain airbags: </strong>they protect the passengers in case of side collisions. They are mounted in the roof above the side doors and, when they activate, they cover the internal side of the cabin, both the front and the back seats. They diminish the collision with the bodywork and protect passengers from getting hurt by broken window glass.</li><li><strong>Rear airbags:</strong> They protect the heads of rear passengers. You can usually find them in compact cars. They cover the rear window in case of a collision.</li></ul><p><strong>External airbags:</strong></p><p>These airbags activate outside of the bodywork.

This system works thanks to certain sensors placed strategically in the bodywork of the car and they are controlled by certain electronic modules. If there is a collision, the car will determine how strong it is and which airbags should be deployed.</p><p>As this system is usually very complex, if you notice any anomaly or if you see a warning light indicating that something is damaged, you should take your car to a specialist as soon as you can. Since these airbags are so important for both your and the other passengers’ safety, you should always have an expert deal with them.</p><h2>When do the airbags get activated in your Punto Evo?</h2><p>When the <strong>car sensors</strong> sense a collision, they send a signal to the car’s <strong>computer</strong>. If the computer decides that the collision is strong enough, it deploys the airbags to protect the people in the car.</p><p>Moments after they have been deployed, the airbags begin to deflate to cushion the collision of the body. This whole cycle happens at a great speed in hundredths of a second.</p><p>Once the airbags have been deployed, they are no longer useful; a specialist should replace them with new ones.</p><h2><div class=\"Article__inline-img\"><img src=\"https://images.rewise.ai/processed/legos/m/airbags_externos.jpg\"></div></h2>"
